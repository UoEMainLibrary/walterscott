              <p align="center">Greatbach's engraving is made after Sir David
                Wilkie's <em>The Entrance of King George the Fourth at Holyrood</em>,
                begun in 1823 and completed in 1829. It shows the King, accompanied
                by trumpeters, a page, and the Exon of the Yeoman of Guard, arriving
                in front of the Palace of Holyrood. Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton,
                the Hereditary Keeper of the Palace, is offering him the keys
                of the Palace. Before the entrance of the building, in full Highland
                dress, stands George 6th Duke of Argyll, Hereditary Master of
                the Household in Scotland. Behind him three mounted figures bear
                the Honours of Scotland: Sir Alexander Keith, the Knight Marischal
                bears the Crown; Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, representing his
                mother the Countess of Sutherland, bears the Sceptre; George
                17th Earl of Morton bears the Sword of State. Standing to the
                right
                of the Knight Marischal, as his Page of Honour, is Sir Walter
                Scott's younger son Charles. Scott himself is the third figure
                from the
                left,
                standing
                next
                to John, 4th Earl of Hopetoun who is wearing the uniform of Captain-General
                of the Royal Company of Archers.<br>
