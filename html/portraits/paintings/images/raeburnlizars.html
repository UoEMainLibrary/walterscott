                  Home Lizars</a> after <a href="../../artists/raeburn.html">Sir Henry

                <p align="center">Lizars's engraving was published in the 2nd
                  edition of J.G. Lockhart's <em>Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk</em> (Edinburgh:
                  William Blackwood, 1819) (vol. II, facing p.351). It was made
                  after a sketch by J.G. Lockhart (employing the pseudonym Peter
                  Morris). Francis Russell in his <em>Portraits of Sir Walter
                  Scott</em> lists this image as a derivation of Raeburn's <a href="../raeburn1808.html">1808
                  portrait</a> of Scott. Corson, however, in unpublished manuscript
                  notes, is of the view that it derives from Raeburn's <a href="../raeburn1809.html">1809
                  portrait</a>. The ruined wall which features in the 1808 portrait
                  is here replaced by a woodland scene that may appear closer
                  to the backdrop of the 1809 version..</p>
