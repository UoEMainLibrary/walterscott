                <td width="52%">Following the Act of Union between England and
                  Scotland in 1707, the ancient Regalia (or 'Honours') of Scotland
                  were deposited
                  in a locked oak chest in the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle.
                  Over the following decades, their whereabouts was forgotten,
                  and it was rumoured that, counter to the terms of the Union,
                  they had been carried away to England. Prompted by Sir Walter
                  Scott, the Prince Regent set up a commission to search the
                  Crown Room for the Regalia. On 4 February 1818, the Commissioners,
                  including Scott, discovered the chest and found, wrapped in
                  linen, the fourteenth-century Scottish Crown, the Sceptre of
                  James V, and the Sword of State, a gift from Pope Julius II
                  to James V. The Regalia were subsequently placed on permanent
                  display in the Crown Room. Scott described the discovery in
                his <em>Description of the Regalia of Scotland </em>(1819).</td>

            <p>In order to satisfy the Prince Regent that the Regalia were authentic,
              the Commissioners were required to submit a report of their proceedings,
              accompanied by scale drawings of the components of the Regalia.              <a href="../artists/geddes.html">Andrew
            Geddes</a> was one of  four artists chosen and produced an ink drawing
            of the Sceptre and an oil sketch of the Crown. Amidst continuing
            public excitement, Geddes prepared a massive group-portrait entitled <em>The
            Discovery of the Regalia of Scotland</em>. It was displayed at the
            Royal Academy in 1821 but had been in progress since 1818 when
            Geddes had prepared
            a <a href="geddes.html">portrait
              of Scott</a> as a study. The finished painting found no buyer,
              owing probably to its sheer size, which, according to David Laing,
              would have been 'sufficient to fill the whole side of an ordinary
              sized apartment'. The canvas remained in Geddes's mother's house
              in Edinburgh until her death in 1828. The family then moved to
              a smaller house and had the painting removed from the frame and
              rolled
              up. It was subsequently so badly neglected that it had
              to be destroyed.
              According to Geddes's widow (who had no part in the neglect), some
              of the heads were cut out and sold as discreet portraits. None,
            however, has been traced. (The correspondence between Adela Plimer
              Geddes and David Laing is held in Edinburgh University Library's
              <a href="http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/about/pubs/lg51/coll/laing.shtml">Laing
              Collection</a>.)</p>
            <p> The only surviving record of the composition
              is a drawing in the British Museum in black chalk and pen (8&frac34; x
              13&frac14; inches), which shows twenty-four Commissioners arranged
              around a table on which the Regalia are displayed. Click on the
