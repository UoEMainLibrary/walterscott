                <td width="66%">The dating of the half-length portrait of Scott
                  made by <a href="../artists/phillips.html">Thomas Phillips</a> for
                  the publisher John Murray remains uncertain. The portrait is
                  mentioned only once in Scott's correspondence in a letter of
                  October 1822 to William Stewart Rose which reveals that it
                  was painted in London but provides no further details of the
                  sitting. In his biography of Scott, J.G. Lockhart dates it
                  to 1818, relying on information provided by Phillips himself.
                  In his <em>Portraits of Sir Walter Scott</em>, however, Francis Russell
                  argues that 1815 is more probable. Scott did not, in fact,
                  visit London in 1818 but spent ten weeks there in 1815, spending
                  a good deal of time at John Murray's where he met Byron. The
                  portrait depicts Scott turned towards the right with a plaid
                  of Stuart tartan over his shoulders. His collar is open and
                  he is holding a cap in his right hand. Click on the thumbnail,

                <td width="62%">The portrait of Scott is one of a series of portraits
                  that Murray commissioned Phillips to paint of the poets that
                  he published, including Byron, Southey, and Crabbe. Russell
                  argues that the Scott portrait was designed as a companion
                  piece to that of Byron. The attitude of Scott and the open
                  collar appear to be inspired by the portrait of Byron (see,
                  right, for an uncredited engraving). Lockhart judged the costume
                  'unfortunately selected', giving 'a theatrical air to what
                  would otherwise have been a very graceful representation of
                  Scott in the 47th year of his age'. For Lockhart, Phillips
                  had 'caught a true expression not hit upon by any of his brethren---a
                  smile of gentle enthusiasm' (X, 260-61). Scott does not appear
                  to have recorded his opinion of the painting but is known to
                  have disliked portraits which aimed for an inspired or poetical
                  effect.</td>

            <p>The picture remained in the Murray family until 1929; current
              ownership is unknown. Francis Russell lists eight engravings made
              after the portrait, copies of two of which are held in the <a href="../../corson.html">Corson
              Collection</a>. Besides the engraving by W.T. Fry (see thumbnail
