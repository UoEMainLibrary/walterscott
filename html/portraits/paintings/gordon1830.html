                of Sir Walter Scott </font></h2>
            <p>The three-quarter length portrait painted by <a href="../artists/gordon.html">Sir
                John Watson Gordon</a>              in 1830 presents Scott in full face and seated with his hands resting
            on his walking stick. He is wearing a dark green coat and a yellowish
              waistcoat. His dog Bran sits to his right and a view of the Eildons
              may be seen to the left.</p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="42%">This portrait was commissioned by Scott's publisher Robert
                  Cadell specifically so that it might be engraved for the 'Magnum
                  Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels (1829-33). Scott was loath
                  to sit for a new painting and would have preferred Cadell to
                  use the 1821 portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence. The copyright
                  to the Lawrence portrait had, however, been bought by another
                  publisher, and Scott finally granted Watson Gordon a single
                  sitting on 4 March 1830. Watson Gordon had, in fact, already
                  commenced work on the portrait, basing his likeness on a bust
                  prepared by the sculptor Lawrence Macdonald and on his own
                  acquaintance with Scott. Bran, whom Scott received as a present
                at the end of March, was added at a later date.</td>

            </table>            <p>Despite the sitter's reluctance, Watson Gordon's 1830 portrait
              is among the most acclaimed likenesses of Scott. Scott's son-in-law
              and
              biographer John Gibson Lockhart thought it 'masterly' and had 'only
              the disadvantage of having been done a little too late' (<font size="3"><i>Memoirs
              of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</i></font>, VII, 276). When
              <a href="../engravers/horsburgh.html">John Horsburgh</a>'s engraving of the portrait appeared in 1832, the
              <em>Edinburgh Advertiser</em> declared: 'Here the desideratum
              of a really characteristic and expressive likeness of Sir Walter
              is at length gained. We cannot conceive, indeed, any portrait more
            exactly like, and at the same time so easy and graceful' (3 February
              1832). The <em>Edinburgh Weekly Journal</em> found it 'deeply affecting',
              noting that 'the painter
              has been so happy as to catch a moment of fine poetical thought,
              which [Scott's] countenance sometimes but not often exhibited'
              but that 'his countenance tells the tale of much toil and labour
              encountered, as well as
              of his share of suffering
              and sorrow endured'. Scott appears 'older than
              he actually is, and those lineaments which formerly played responsive
              to the
              varying
              thought, are now fixed in the habitual contemplative character
            of his mind' (8 February 1832). </p>
            <p>At least five engravings were made of the complete portrait: by
              <a href="../engravers/horsburgh.html">John Horsburgh</a> (1831),
              Blanchard (1833), <a href="../engravers/robinson.html">Henry Robinson</a> (1836), <a href="../engravers/holl.html">William
              Holl the Younger</a> (1841), and 'C.R.' (1890). Signed derivations
              were engraved by <a href="../engravers/hall.html">Henry Bryan Hall</a> (1837), T. Crawford (1838), <a href="../engravers/wrankmore.html">W.
              C. Wrankmore</a> (1845), and A. G. Campbell (1868). Five further unsigned
              derivations
              have been recorded. In addition, three signed replicas of the portrait
              were painted by Watson Gordon, including one for the Speculative
              Society (see below) where Bran sits to Scott's left.</p>
