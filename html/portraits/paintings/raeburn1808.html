            <p><a href="images/raeburnhorsburgh.html"><img src="graphics/raeburnhorsburgh2.jpg" alt="Sir Walter Scott, engraved by  John Horsburgh after Sir Henry Raeburn, 1837 (Corson Corson P.7399) " width="193" height="250" hspace="10" border="0" align="right"></a>In
              1808, Scott's publisher Archibald Constable, delighted by the unprecedented
              success of Scott's second narrative poem <a href="../../works/poetry/marmion.html"><em>Marmion</em></a>,
              commissioned a portrait from <a href="../artists/raeburn.html">Sir
              Henry Raeburn</a>. Unlike the earlier
              portraits of Scott which were designed for a private, domestic
              setting, Raeburn's
              portrait was very much conceived with reproduction in mind. For
              over a decade, it would be the most frequently engraved and widely
              diffused image of Scott. It proved immensely influential not only
              in framing Scott in the public's mind-eye but in creating a prototype
              for Romantic portraiture. Here for the first time Scott is explicitly
              personified as a poet in a setting imbued with allusions to his
              own work. He is portrayed deep in thought, with a notebook in one
              hand and a pen in the other. He sits on a fallen stone before a
              ruined medieval tower with his favourite dog <a href="../miscellaneous/camp.html">Camp</a> at
              his feet. In the background may be seen the hills of Liddesdale
              and Hermitage Castle, which are featured both in <em>Marmion</em> and <a href="../../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html"><em>Minstrelsy
              of the Scottish Border</em></a>. Click on the thumbnail to the
              right to see an engraving of Raeburn's 1808 portrait made by <a href="../engravers/horsburgh.html">John
              Horsburgh</a>. </p>
            <p>When exhibited in Edinburgh in 1809, the <em>Scots Magazine</em> judged
              it 'an admirable painting, with most appropriate scenery'. The <em>Repository
              of Arts</em>, however, wrote that: 'This last of the minstrels
              shows how lamentably the race is degenerated, for never was a more
              unpoetical physiognomy delineated on canvas; we might take him
              for an auctioneer or a land-surveyor, a travelling dealer or chapman:
              in short for any character but a bard' (III, 18:VI:1810, p. 36).
              Scott's friend J.S. Morritt considered it 'a most faithful likeness'.
              Scott's expression was 'serious and contemplative, very unlike
              the hilarity and vivacity then habitual to his speaking face, but
              quite true to what it was in the absence of such excitement'. However,
              Morritt felt that Raeburn had failed to convey the 'flashes of
              the mind within' which 'almost always lighted up' features that
              might otherwise appear 'commonplace and heavy' (quoted in Lockhart, <em>Life</em>,
              2nd ed., III, 99-100).</p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="52%"><p>Scott himself shared Morritt's view that in
                    aiming for solemnity Raeburn had given him a somewhat stolid
                    air. His features are softened in an alternative version
                    painted for Scott himself by Raeburn in 1809. Eventually,
                    though, Scott appears to have been reconciled to the 1808
                    portrait. When Archibald Constable was bankrupted in 1826
                    (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html#1826">The Fall
                    of Archibald Constable and Co.</a>), the painting was purchased
                    by Scott's patron the 5th Duke of Buccleuch. In a letter
                    to the Duke of 14 December 1826, Scott wrote: 'I must say
                    I was extremely gratified by seeing Raeburns portrait (which
                    was like what the original was some two or three years before
                    your Grace was born) hanging at Dalkeith and feel sincerely
                    the kindness which placed it there. One does not like the
                    idea of being knockd down even though it is only in effigy'
                    (<em>Letters</em>, X, 139-40). Today the painting still hangs
                    at Bowhill, home of the Dukes of Buccleuch.</p>
                    <p>Many published engravings were made after Raeburn's 1808
                      portrait. In his <em>Portraits of Sir Walter Scott</em>,
                      Francis Russell lists 6 engravings of the complete portrait
                      and 14 derivations including partial reproductions and
                      variations on Raeburn's original. A mark of the ubiquity
                      and recognisability of the image is its incorporation into
                      the lyre on the title-page of the 1823 anthology <em>The
                      Beauties of Scottish Poets, Ancient and Modern </em>(see
                      right).</p>
