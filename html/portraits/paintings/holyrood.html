            <h2><font color="#003366"><em>The Entrance of King George the Fourth
                at Holyrood</em> (1829)</font></h2>
            <p>In August 1822, George IV became the first Hanoverian monarch
              to visit Scotland. Scott played a leading role in organizing the
              visit and acted as master of ceremonies. <a href="../artists/wilkie.html">Sir
              David 
              Wilkie</a> travelled
              to Edinburgh at the same time as the king with a view to recording
              the event. He witnessed his arrival at the Royal Palace of Holyrood
              and included it in a list of possible pictures. He should actually
              have preferred to portray the royal visit to St Giles's Cathedral,
              but the king insisted that he record the return to the palace of
              his ancestors. </p>

              <tr>
                <td width="58%">Wilkie began work on the picture in October 1823
                  shortly after he succeeded <a href="../artists/raeburn.html">Sir
                  Henry Raeburn</a> as His Majesty's Limner for Scotland. The
                  king disliked the first study, as he felt he was posed too
                  informally and demanded that he be given a more martial air.
                  Wilkie modified his design accordingly and had made substantial
                  progress by summer 1824. In July 1824, however, the king requested
                  that Wilkie include Scott and his younger son Charles (see
                  detail, right) amongst his entourage in the painting (as recorded
                  in Scott's letter to Lady Abercorn, 1 August 1824, <em>Letters</em>,
                  VIII, 340).</td>

                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Wilkie returned to Scotland later that summer to make further
              studies for the painting, and visited <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> in
              November in order to take Scott's likeness. One of his studies
              of the writer was subsequently worked up as a portrait in its own
              right for Sir William Knighton (see <a href="wilkie.html">Sir David
              Wilkie's 1824 Portrait of Sir Walter Scott</a>). Wilkie cut short
              his stay at Abbotsford upon hearing that his mother had suddenly
              been taken ill. He reached London on the 12th to learn that she
              had died the previous day. Her unexpected death, followed, in rapid
              succession, by further family bereavements and the collapse of
              his printsellers, contributed to a breakdown in Wilkie's health
              which left him incapable of working. He left on a convalescent
              trip to the Continent in July 1824 and did not return to Britain
              until June 1828. In February 1829, he finally felt able to return
              to the massive Holyrood group-portrait. He made a further visit
              to Scotland in the autumn of that year in order to confirm the
              veracity of some of the details, staying at Abbotsford on the return
              journey. Wilkie's correspondence suggests that he finally finished
              the painting in December 1829. The painting itself may well have
              born that date but the area to the right of the signature is badly
              preserved and the writing illegible. The finished painting, measuring
              49 x 78 inches, was delivered to George IV early in 1830 and unveiled
              at the Royal Academy's Annual Exhibition later that year.</p>

            <p>It met with a lukewarm reception and was only engraved once: by <a href="../engravers/greatbach.html">William
                Greatbach</a> for the <em>Art-Journal</em> in 1858 (see top of page).
                It remains in the Royal Collection and is currently held at <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page559.asp">Holyrood
