            <h2><font color="#003366">Sir Henry Raeburn's 1809 Portrait of Sir
                Walter Scott</font></h2>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="50%">Scott disliked the solemn and intent cast of
                  his features in Sir Henry Raeburn's <a href="raeburn1808.html">1808
                  portrait</a>. These were softened, very possibly at Scott's
                  instigation, in a version that he had painted for himself in
                  1809. However, as Scott was later to write that Raeburn had
                  'twice made a very chowderheaded [i.e. clumsy- or thick-headed]
                  person of me' (<em>Letters</em>, V, 349), it appears that he
                  remained unsatisfied. Other minor changes were made. Scott's
                  greyhound Percy was introduced, and the original backdrop --
                  a ruined tower with, in the distance, a view of Hermitage Castle
                  and the Liddesdale Hills -- was replaced by trees and a view
                  of Yarrow. The green coat that Scott wears in the 1808 picture
                  gives way to a more homely brown. Where the earlier portrait
                  presents Scott as a poet amidst the very scenery that he has
                  celebrated in his verse, the latter is a more personal, domestic
                  portrait.</td>

            <p>Only one reproduction appears to have been made of the 1809 portrait.
              When <a href="../../biography/homes.html">39 North Castle Street</a> was
              sold following the <a href="../../biography/finance.html">financial
              crash</a> of 1826, Scott's friend, James Skene of Rubislaw agreed
              to look after the picture (<em>Letters</em>, VIII, 453). In 1831
              Scott asked for it to be returned and offered to pay for a copy
              to be made. Skene, however, had already had a facsimile made by
              <a href="../artists/gordon.html">Sir John Watson Gordon</a>. The facsimile was acquired by Dr Corson
              in 1961, and an image will shortly appear on this page. In unpublished
              notes, Corson opined that the <a href="images/raeburnlizars.html">engraved
              portrait</a> of Scott by <a href="../engravers/lizars.html">W.H.
              Lizars</a> in J.G. Lockhart's <em>Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk</em> is
              based on a sketch made by Lockhart of the 1809 portrait. Francis
              Russell, however, in his <em>Portraits of Sir Walter Scott</em> lists
              this as a version of the 1808 portrait. The original portrait hangs
              at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>.</p>
