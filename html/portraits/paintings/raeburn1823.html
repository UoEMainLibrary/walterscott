            <h2><font color="#003366">Sir Henry Raeburn's 1823 Portraits of Sir
                Walter Scott</font></h2>
            <p>In 1819, Charles Montagu-Scott, 4th Duke of Buccleuch, asked Scott
              to sit to Raeburn for a portrait destined to hang in the library
              of the Buccleuch family home of Bowhill. Scott replied:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font color="#003366"><strong>Respecting the portrait I shall
                    be equally proud and happy to sit for it &amp; hope it may
                    be executed in some degree worthy of the preferment to which
                    it is destined. But neither my late golden hue for I was
                    coverd with jaundice nor my present silver complection looking
                    much more like a spectre than a man will present any idea
                    of my quondam beef-eating physiognomy. I must wait till the
                    age of brass the true juridical bronze of my profession shall
                    again appear on my frontal. I hesitate a little about Raeburn
                    unless your Grace is quite determined. He has very much to
                    do works just now chiefly for cash poor fellow as he can
                    have but a few years to make money and has twice made a very
                    chowderheaded </strong></font>[i.e. clumsy- or thick-headed] <font color="#003366"></font><strong><font color="#003366">person
                    of me. I should like much (always with your approbation)
                    to try</font> </strong>[Sir William]<font color="#003366"> <strong>Allan
                    who is a man of real genius and has made one or two glorious
                    portraits though his predilection is to the historical branch
                    of the art. </strong></font>(15 April 1819, <em>Letters</em>,
                    V, 349)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Scott's reservations relate to the stolid appearance that he believed
              Raeburn had given him in his portraits of <a href="raeburn1808.html">1808</a> and <a href="../paintings/raeburn1808.html">1809</a>.
              His letter, however, did not reach the Duke who died on 20 April
              1819. In 1823, the Duke's brother Lord Montagu of Boughton asked
              Scott to fulfil the engagement. Scott undertook to make arrangements
              with Raeburn but, before he could do so, was himself contacted
              by Raeburn who wished to paint the writer for his private gallery
              of friends and associates. It was agreed that Scott would sit for
              two portraits simultaneously, one for Lord Montagu, the other for
              Raeburn in exchange for a series of carvings from the ancient Mercat
              Cross of Edinburgh then to be found in the painter's gothic rockery.
              There is no evidence as to when the pictures were begun, but Maria
              Edgeworth reported both to be in a relatively advanced stage on
              12 June 1823 when she and her sisters visited Raeburn's studio.
              Two hours after this visit Scott and Raeburn set out together for
              the
              annual meeting of the Blairadam Club (a society of antiquarians)
              in Fife. Less than three weeks later, on 8 July, Raeburn was dead.
              That same day Scott wrote to Benjamin Robert Haydon:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font color="#003366"><strong>This has been a severe season
                    for the arts: about a fortnight since I had a very merry
                    party through Fifeshire, with our Chief Baron (Sergeant Shepherd)
                    and the Lord Chief Commissioner, and above all, Sir H. Raeburn,
                    our famous portrait painter. No one could seem more healthy
                    than he was, or more active, and of an athletic spare habit,
                    that seemed made for a very long life. But this morning I
                    have the melancholy news of his death after three days illness,
                    by which painting is deprived of a votary of genius, our
                    city of an ornament, and society of a most excellent and
                    most innocent member.</strong> </font>(<em>Letters</em>, VIII, 32)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>On 17 July Scott wrote to Lord Montagu:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font color="#003366"><strong>Poor Sir Henry Reaburn </strong></font>[sic]<font color="#003366"><strong> is
                    no more- He was over in Fife with the Chief Commissioner
                    Chief Baron &amp; myself on a pleasure party about three
                    weeks hence and I never saw a man in better health. But he
                    died of water in the head a hopeless disease which must have
                    been long in the constitution. When he came back from Fife
                    he said now I am better acquainted with your face than ever
                    I was (having been three or four days in company) I will
                    finish Lord Montagu's picture &amp; my own for I had agreed
                    long since to sit to him on his own account and both pictures
                    were nearly finishd. I went accordingly and sate to him for
                    nearly three hours when he finishd his own head in a most
                    masterly manner and did a great deal to that designd to your
                    Lordship but chiefly to the drapery. I upbraided him in jest
                    with having taken best care of himself &amp; he allowd he
                    had but agreed whenever the paint on your copy was dry I
                    should have a finishing sitting. All this being the case
                    I think your Lordship should have the finishd picture which
                    is really considerd as the best likeness which ever has been
                    made of so indifferent an original for your Lordship cannot
                    certainly be expected to take the unfinishd picture which
                    would require one long sitting to bring it to the same perfection.
                    In all respects they are quite the same only the dress is
                    different to show that both were originals. </strong></font>(<em>Letters</em>,
                    VIII, 45-46)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Scott subsequently wrote to the painter's son requesting that
              Lord Montagu be offered the refusal of the more complete portrait
              if it were to be sold (<em>Letters,</em> VIII, 62-64). The painter's
              family, however, were determined to keep the portrait as one of
              Raeburn's last and greatest works. In fact, Raeburn had worked
              on the portrait commissioned by Montagu after the writer had last
              seen it, and it was far nearer completion than Scott had feared.
              Indeed, Scott was to judge Lord Montagu's version 'a better picture
              (the subject considered) than any one but Lawrence could at present
              produce' (letter to Lady Louisa Stuart, 4 April 1824, <em>Letters</em>,
              VIII, 245).</p>

            <p>The version painted for Lord Montagu presents Scott in different
              clothes. His coat has a fur collar and his vest is of a light colour.
              It is now own by Sir Peter Usher, Bt., Hawick. Four painted copies
