            <h2><font color="#003366">The Abbotsford Family (1817)</font></h2>
            <p><a href="../artists/wilkie.html">Sir David Wilkie</a> first met
              Scott in London in 1809 when both dined with the publisher John
              Murray. He found the writer 'most interesting in conversation'
              and 'very communicative of the all but universal knowledge he has
              acquired'. Their paths did not however cross again until October
              1817 when Wilkie was invited to <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> during
              a visit to Scotland. Here he was commissioned by Scott's friend
              Sir Adam Fergusson to paint the group composition that was to become <em>The
              Abbotsford Family</em>. He began work immediately, making rapid
              progress on the picture during the fortnight that he spent as a
              guest of Scott. The portraits of Lady Scott, Scott's daughters
              Sophia and Anne, son's Walter and Charles, friend Sir Adam Fergusson,
              and shepherd Thomas Scott are all taken from life. Scott himself
              provided Wilkie with a dilemma. He was loath to trouble Scott to
              sit for a portrait as he knew him to be hard at work on <em><a href="../../works/novels/robroy.html">Rob
              Roy</a></em>.
              After several days, however, he perceived that Scott 'always had
              time
              for less important purposes' and conquered his scruples. The painting
              was displayed in the 1818 exhibition at the Royal Academy, but
              there is evidence that the artist worked upon it subsequently,
              retouching
              in particular the portrait of Lady Scott which her husband did
              not judge to be a good likeness.</p>

            <p>Scott later described the painting in a letter to Fergusson of
              7 March 1827:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font color="#003366"><strong><img src="graphics/maida.jpg" alt="" width="159" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The
                    idea which our inimitable Wilkie adopted was to represent
                    our family group in the garb of South country peasants supposed
                    to be concerting a merry-making, for which some of the preparations
                    are seen. The place is the terrace near Kayside</strong></font><strong> </strong>[or
                    'Kaeside', a property added to the Abbotsford estate in 1817]<font color="#003366"><strong>,
                    commanding an extensive view towards the Eildon Hills. 1.
                    The sitting figure, in the dress of a miller, I believe,
                    represents Sir Walter Scott author of a few scores of volumes,
                    and proprietor of Abbotsford. 2. In front, and presenting,
                    we may suppose, a country wag, addicted to poaching stands
                    Sir Adam Fergusson, Knight-Keeper of the Regalia of Scotland.
                    3. In the background is a very handsome old man </strong></font>[Thomas
                    Scott]<font color="#003366"><strong>, upwards of eighty four
                    years old at the time, painted in his own character of a
                    shepherd. He used to claim credit for three things unusual
                    among the South-land shepherds: first, that he had never
                    been fou </strong></font>[drunk] <font color="#003366"><strong>in
                    the course of his life; secondly, never had struck a man
                    in anger; thirdly, that though entrusted with the management
                    of large sales of stock, he had never lost a penny for his
                    master by a bad debt. He died soon afterwards, at Abbotsford.
                    4. 5. 6. Of the three female figures the eldest is the late
                    regretted mother of the family represented. 5. The young
                    person most forward in the group is Miss Sophia Charlotte
                    Scott, now Mrs John Gibson Lockhart, and, 6, her younger
                    sister Miss Anne Scott. Both are represented as ewe milkers,
                    with their leglins, or milk pails. 7. On the left hand of
                    the shepherd, the young man holding a fowling-piece is the
                    eldest son of Sir Walter, now Captain in the Kings Hussars.
                    8. The boy is the youngest of the family, now, Charles Scott,
                    of Brazen Nose College, Oxford. The two dogs were distinguished
                    favourites of the family. The large one </strong></font>[Maida,
                    see right]<font color="#003366"><strong> was a stag-hound
                    of the old Highland breed, and one of the handsomest dogs
                    that could be found. He was a present from the Chief of Glengarry
                    to Sir Walter, and was highly valued both on account of his
                    beauty, his fidelity and the great rarity of the breed. The
                    other is a little Highland terrier called <em>Ourisk</em> (goblin),
                    of a particular kind bred in Kintail. It was a present from
                    the Honourable Mrs Stewart Mackenzie and is a valuable specimen
                    of a breed which is now also scarce. (</strong></font><em>Letters</em>,
                    X, 168-69)       
            </blockquote>
            <p> Scott himself (<em>see detail below</em>) is portrayed at full-length,
              wearing a slate-blue coat, cerise waistcoat, white shirt, black
              stock,
              and
              buff trousers
              and hat, the costume which, according to a review in <em>Blackwood's
              Magazine</em> was his customary attire when inspecting his estate.
              The painting is 10&frac34; by 14&frac12; inches. 
            <p align="center"><img src="graphics/abbotscott.jpg" width="225" height="250">
            <p>The Scott family appear to have been highly pleased by the painting.
              Scott wrote to Wilkie that 'I cannot tell you how acceptable the
              picture has been to all who have seen and how much the relatives
              of the party honoured (not always easily gratified you know) are
              delighted with your having commemorated them' (letter of 23 January
              1818, <em>Letters</em>, V, 93). Likewise, in a letter to Lady Compton,
              he referred to is 'a very good picture' by 'this modest and most
              promising artist' which is 'prodigiously admired by Scotch amateurs
              at least as a piece of art'.
            <p><img src="graphics/abbotferg.jpg" width="140" height="200" align="right">Critical
              reaction has been rather more mixed. For <em>Blackwood's Magazine</em> the
              portrait might have lacked 'the fine poetical tone' of Sir Henry
              Raeburn's <a href="raeburn1808.html">1808 portrait</a>, but 'we
              have seen no painting which places the individual, in his <em>every-day</em> feelings,
              so completely before the spectator'. The <em>Monthly Magazine</em>,
              conversely, condemned it as 'a most conceited design' which 'creates
              pity for the painter and disgust at the objects, while it violates
              decency and good taste'. Scott's son-in-law Lockhart regretted
              that he could not 'express much approbation of the representation
              of Sir Walter, introduced by Sir David Wilkie in his picture of &quot;The
              Abbotsford Family;'' nor indeed are any of the likenesses in that
              beautiful piece (1817) at all satisfactory to me, except only that
              of Sir Adam Fergusson [<em>see detail right</em>], which is perfect'
              (<em>Life</em>, X, 263). A more recent biographer, Dame Una Pope-Hennessy
              thought it 'a wax-like arrangement of expressionless little dummies'
              to be dismissed as 'a kind of joke' (<em>Quarterly Review</em>,
              259 (1932), 82).
            <p>The <em>Abbotsford Family </em>remained in the Fergusson family
              until 1895 when it was sold to the <a href="http://www.natgalscot.ac.uk/">Scottish
              National Portrait Gallery</a>. It <em>w</em>as engraved on four
              occasions: by <a href="../engravers/worthington.html">W.H. Worthington</a> (1828),
              Robert Graves (1837), <a href="../engravers/jsmith.html">John
              Smith</a>              (1847), and
                  <a href="../engravers/greatbach.html">William Greatbach</a> (184-?).
