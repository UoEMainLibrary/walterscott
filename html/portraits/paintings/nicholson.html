            <h2><font color="#003366">William Nicholson's Portraits
                of Sir Walter Scott (1816-17)</font></h2>
            <p><a href="images/nicholsonphoto.html"><img src="graphics/erskine2.jpg" width="202" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right">William
                  Nicholson</a> painted at least three watercolour portraits
                  of Scott. Varying only slightly, these presumably stem
                  from the
                  same sitting, of which, unfortunately, no record remains. The
                  most detailed version was exhibited in Edinburgh 1816. It shows
                  Scott in three-quarter
                  face turned
                    to
                    the left. Seated
                    on a chair,
                    he
                    wears a black
                    coat
                    and waistcoat,
                    with
                    white
                    shirt and neckcloth. Scott's dog Maida, who was acquired
                  in April 1816, sits in the foreground. In the background,
                  there are targes
                    and a curtain. This painting remained in the hands of Nicholson's
                  descendants until 1932 when it was purchased by the <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/index.asp">Scottish
                  National Portrait Gallery</a>. The Gallery also owns a variant
                  in pencil and watercolour purchased from the descendents of
                  Scott's friend William Erskine, Lord Kinedder, in 1928. Although
                  this picture bears no date, it appears to have been obtained
                  by Erskine in 1817. This version omits
                  Maida.
                  As a consequence, Scott's left arm dangles over the back of
                  the
                  chair,
                  the
                  lower
                  part
                  of his waistcoat is altered, his right arm is lowered so that
                  the hand is no longer shown, and the background is blank. A
                  very similar version from the collection
                  of Lord Young, entirely in watercolour, was exhibited
                  at the R.S.A. in 1880. Its current location is unknown. The
                  <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em> states that a further variant
                  is to be found at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>, but Francis Russell could find
                  no trace of it. None of these portraits appears ever to have
                  been engraved. Click
              on the thumbnail, above right, however, to see a photogravure of
                  the Erskine Family variant, published in an American edition
                  of
                  Lockhart's
                  <em>Life</em> (1902).</p>

                <td width="45%">In 1817 Nicholson etched a portrait of Scott
                  which was published in 1818 in his <em>Portraits
                  of Distinguished Living Characters of Scotland</em>. He worked
                  from a drawing of his own which clearly stemmed (directly or
                  indirectly) from the same sitting that produced the watercolour
                  portraits. It strongly resembles the first of the portraits
                  described above, but Maida has been moved slightly to the right,
                  making more of Scott's waistcoat visible. Click on the thumbnail,
                  right, to see a full-size image. Two further engravings of
                  this image were subsequently made, by James Thomson and Robert
                Hicks; click <a href="images/thomson.html">here</a> to see Thomson's
                version.</td>
