            <p>The half-length portrait painted by <a href="../artists/gordon.html">Sir
                John Watson Gordon</a> in 1820 presents Scott in full face, holding
                his terrier Ourisque, and wearing a brown coat over a buff waistcoat.</p>

              <tr>
                <td width="45%">In 1820 Anne Hamilton, Marchioness of Abercorn,
                  asked Sir Walter Scott to sit for a portrait for her, leaving
                  the choice of painter up to him. Lady Abercorn, a great admirer
                  of Scott's work, was one of his most intimate correspondents,
                  and, by 1820, belonged to the 'inner circle' of friends to
                  whom he had confessed his authorship of the Waverley Novels.
                  Scott's choice of painter fell on a distant relative, Sir John
                  Watson Gordon (then known simply as John Watson). Watson Gordon
                  was a second cousin of Scott's on his mother's side. In his <em>Journal</em> (13
                  April 1831), Scott recalled his parents inviting the painter's
                  father Captain James Watson to their home in <a href="../../biography/homes.html">George
                  Square</a> in the vain hope that his tales of hardship at sea
                  might dissuade Scott's brother Robert from joining the Navy.</td>

            <p>Scott sat for Watson Gordon at some point between 1 June 1820,
              when he informed Lady Abercorn that 'the sitting for my picture
              is not quite begun yet' (<em>Letters</em>, VI, 201), and 1 July
              when he reported 'the portrait is advancing by the pencil of a
              clever artist and will I think be a likeness and a tolerably good
              picture' (VI, 217). Scott asked Lady Abercorn to forgive him 'if
              I look a little sleepy' as 'I had to make my attendance on the
              man of colours betwixt six and seven in the morning.' A letter
              of 2 August 1820 confirms that the portrait is complete and has
              been consigned to the post. Scott adds: 'The dog which I am represented
              as holding in my arms is a Highland terrier from Kintail of a breed
              very sensible very faithful, and very ill-natured. It sometimes
              tires or pretends to do so when I am on horseback and whines to
              be taken up when it sits before me like a child without any assistance.'
              (VI, 252)</p>
            <p align="left">Lady Abercorn replied on 10 August that she hoped
              the portrait 'was as like you as your Bust [by <a href="../paintings/chantrey.html">Chantrey</a>]'.
              Even if it did not depict 'one of the most distinguished men of
              this age', she would value it 'as that of one of the best of friends,
              one that circumstances has [sic] only changed in showing more kindness
              and Attachment in Adversity than in prosperity' (VI, 253).</p>
            <p align="left">The painting was badly damaged when Rougham Hall
              was bombed in 1940 and subsequently cut down. The signature and
              the dog no longer exist. It was never engraved but photogravures
              were taken for <font size="3"><em>The Scott Exhibition MDCCCLXXI</em></font> (1872)
              and Caw's <em>Scott Gallery</em> (1903).</p>
