              <tr>
                <td width="52%"><p>Little information is available on the first
                    known portrait of Scott, an unsigned head and shoulder length
                    miniature painted during a childhood stay in Bath. Painted
                    in watercolour on ivory and measuring 2 x 1&frac12; inches,
                    it shows a fair-haired young Scott in profile to the left,
                    wearing a scarlet dress with a white collar. According to
                    Lockhart, Scott was six years old at the time of sitting,
                    but he may have overestimated his age. It is difficult to
                    establish precise dates for Scott's visit to Bath, where
                    he was sent in the hope that the spa waters might help cure
                    his lameness (see <a href="../../biography/sandy.html">Sandyknowe
                    and Early Childhood</a>). Scott set off for England in the
                    summer of 1775, visited London en route, and subsequently
                    spent around a year in Bath. It seems reasonable to assign
                    the portrait to summer 1776, when Scott would have been five
                    years old or nearly so.</p>
                    <p>Lockhart erroneously believed that the copy of the miniature
                      displayed at <a href="../../biography/homes.html"> Abbotsford </a>was
                      the original, and it was used as the source for <a href="../engravers/horsburgh.html">John
                      Horsburgh</a>'s engraving for the second Edition of Lockhart's <font size="3"><i>Memoirs
                      of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</i> (1839). The
                      original, however, was given by Scott's mother to Mrs.
                      Captain Watson, wife of Andrew Watson, and was subsequently
                      acquired by <a href="http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/about/bgallery/Gallery/records/eighteen/laing.html">David
                      Laing</a>. Laing bequeathed it to the <a href="http://www.socantscot.org/">Society
                      of Antiquaries of Scotland</a> who in turn gifted it to

            <p>To date, no altogether satisfactory attribution for the miniature
              has been proposed, but Francis Russell, in his definitive study
              of <em>Portraits of Sir Walter Scott </em>(see <a href="#biblio">Bibliography</a>),
              is inclined to accept Sir John Pope-Hennessy's suggestion that
              the artist may be 'Daniels of Bath'. A group of miniatures attributed
              to 'Daniels of Bath' may be the work of Abraham Daniel (d. 1806)
              or his brother Joseph (ca. 1760-1803), or distributed between the
              two. Both artists appear to have worked in or around Bath in the
              last three decades of the eighteenth century. As they appear to
              have set up in opposition and both claimed to be 'Mr Daniel', there
              is considerable difficulty in assigning miniatures to one or the
              other. As only Abraham left a signed work (a portrait of Rabbi
              Moses Ephraim of Plymouth), art historians have tended to attribute
              work to him alone. Daphne Foskett provides a description of the
              characteristic style of 'Daniels of Bath' which matches well with
              that of the 'Bath Miniature':</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Their style of painting is easily recognisable once it has been
                studied, the hair is painted softly, in large masses, without
                much detail, the eyes are large and usually wide open, the eyelids
                strongly delineated, and the features shaded so as to emphasize
                the modelling of the cheeks and nose; the mouth is clearly defined,
                and the general effect of the work is that it has a slightly
                glossy appearance, due to the use of gum with the pigments.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Lockhart judged the Bath portrait 'a very good miniature'. The
              outline of the profile was 'wonderfully like what it was to the
              last; the expression of the eyes and mouth very striking -- grave
              and pensive' (IX, 259).</p>
