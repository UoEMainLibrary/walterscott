                    a small half-length portrait of Scott measuring 17 by 14
                    inches. The writer is depicted almost in profile to the right;
                    he is holding a book in his left hand, his clothes are dark,
                    and his shirt is open at the neck. Originally painted for
                    Wilkie's friend, Sir William Knighton, the portrait now hangs
                    in Parliament Hall, Edinburgh. Click on the thumbnail, right,

            <p>The 1824 portrait
              began life as a study for Wilkie's <em><a href="holyrood.html">The
                Entrance of King George the Fourth at Holyrood</a></em>, where
                Scott was to figure among the King's attendants. Scott granted
                Wilkie
                two sittings at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> on
                9 and 10 November. The first was witnessed by the artist William
                Bewick who was surprised to find
                that Wilkie intended to model the picture on Sir Joshua Reynolds's
                portrait of Oliver Goldsmith. Bewick had expected hat
                Wilkie would aim for 'something of his own [...] an original
                impression of the individual character'. The house had been full
                of company, and Scott's guests had crowded into his library to
                watch Wilkie at work. Wilkie had seemed irritated by this circumstance,
                but Scott, an experienced sitter, had succeeded in maintaining
                his position while participating freely in the general conversation
                (<em>Life and Letters of William Bewick</em>, I, pp. 252-3).
                As Francis Russell argues, Wilkie's decision to model his portrait
              on Reynolds's Goldsmith suggests strongly that he intended the
              portrait to have an independent existence over and above its role
              as a sketch for <em>The Entrance of King George</em>.
              The elements imitative of Reynolds -- the open-neck collar, the
            position of the book -- are absent from the group portrait. For comparison,

              Goldsmith by J.H. Baker:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/goldsmith.html"><img src="graphics/goldsmith.jpg" width="201" height="250" border="0"></a></p>            <p>The
              portrait was incomplete when Wilkie left for the Continent in 1825
              in	an	effort to recover his health, which had been
              badly shaken by a series of family bereavements and by
              the financial collapse
              of his printsellers. Scott was 'deeply grieved' to hear of Wilkie's
              troubles for it was 'impossible for any man to have more admiration
              of his talents than I have, and yet even that was inferior to the
              regard inspired by the virtuous simplicity of his character'.
              During the sittings at Abbotsford, Scott had 'observed with regret
              [Wilkie] was in very low spirits, which I imputed to the illness
              of his mother'. 'I am convinced,' Scott added, 'that mere men of
              the world have not the slightest conception of the tax paid by
              artists, poets, and musicians for the power of giving them pleasure.'
              (To
              Sir George Beaumont, 28 August 1825, <em>Letters</em>, IX, 215.)</p>
            <p>Following his return
            in 1828, Wilkie worked up the portrait for Sir William
              Knighton. In January 1829, Wilkie wrote to Scott proposing that
              it be engraved for inclusion in the Magnum Opus edition
              of the Waverley Novels. Scott gratefully accepted the offer but
              was advised by the engraver <a href="../engravers/cheath.html">Charles
              Heath</a> that it was
              a very poor resemblance. Scott disliked and distrusted Heath and
              asked his son-in-law J.G. Lockhart for a second opinion. This proved
equally              negative, and the portrait did not appear in the Magnum
              Opus. Scott, however, declared himself 'extremely gratified' by
              Wilkie's
              depiction
              of his 'unworthy person' (to Wilkie, 1 February 1830, <em>Letters</em>,
              XI, 291).</p>
            <p>The portrait appears to have been engraved only once, by <a href="../engravers/esmith.html">Edward
              Smith</a> in 1829 (see top of page). Although the image was judged
              unsuitable for the Magnum Opus, Smith's engraving appeared in Cadell's
              edition
              of
              <em>The Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott</em> (1830).</p>
