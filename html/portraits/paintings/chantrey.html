                <td width="54%"><div align="left"><a href="../artists/chantrey.html">Sir
                      Francis Chantrey</a>'s 1820 bust of Sir Walter Scott portrays
                      the author with his head turned slightly to the right and
                      a Lowland plaid arranged round his shoulders. One of the
                      most iconic and frequently reproduced images of Scott,
                      it was acclaimed by his friends and associates as a particularly
                      close likeness. For Scott's son-in-law and biographer John
                      Gibson Lockhart, it was 'that bust which alone preserves
                      for posterity the cast of expression most fondly remembered
                      by all who ever mingled in his domestic circle' (<font size="3"><i>Memoirs
                      of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</i></font>, IV,
                      262). For J. B. S. Morritt, 'Chantrey alone has in his
                      bust attained that [...] most difficult task of portraying
                      the features faithfully, and yet giving the real and transient
                      expression of the countenance when animated' (quoted in
                      Lockhart, II, 183). James Hogg wrote that 'Sir Walter Scott
                      in his study, and in his seat in the Parliament-house,
                      had rather a dull, heavy appearance, but in company his
                      countenance was always lighted up, and Chantrey has given
                      the likeness of him there precisely' (<em>Domestic Manners
                      of Sir Walter Scott</em>, p. 113). </div>

            <p>The proposal that Scott sit for a bust came from Chantrey himself.
              In a letter to Sir Robert Peel (1838), Chantrey explained that
              it was his 'admiration of Scott, as a poet and a man' which induced
              him to approach Scott while he was visiting London in spring 1820.
              It was 'the only time I ever recollect having asked a similar favour
              from any one' (quoted in Lockhart, VII, 430). Scott was an admirer
              of Chantrey -- he thought his statues of Robert Blair and Robert
              Dundas, Lord Melville in Parliament House, Edinburgh, 'as like
              the original subjects as marble can do to flesh &amp; blood' (to
              Charles William Henry Scott, 4th Duke of Buccleuch, 14 November
              1818, <em>Letters</em>, V, 217) -- and readily agreed. Chantrey
              stipulated that Scott should take breakfast with him before each
              sitting and should always bring up to three friends, all good conversationists.
              The bust required seven settings in March and April 1820 at which
              Scott was accompanied by, amongst others, John Wilson Croker, Richard
              Heber, John Fuller, and Lord Lyttelton.</p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="59%">According to a memorandum by the poet Alan Cunningham
                  (who was Chantrey's clerk of works), Chantrey originally intended
                  'to seize a poetical phasis of Scott's countenance' (quoted
                  in Lockhart, IV, 363). He thus initially modelled Scott looking
                  upwards with a grave and solemn expression. Having seen the
                  writer in animated conversation, however, Chantrey was soon
                  convinced that 'a perfectly serene expression' (IV, 365) would
                  never capture the spirit of the man. After two sittings he
                  renounced his original plan and remodelled the bust in its
                  present pose. Arriving for his third sitting, Scott exclaimed:
                  'Ay ye're mair like yoursel now! -- Why, Mr. Chantrey, no witch
                  of old ever performed such cantrips with clay as this.' Scott
                  shared his enthusiasm with his wife Charlotte in a letter of
                  20 March 1820, judging Chantrey's bust 'one of the finest things
                  he ever did' and adding that it was already 'quite the fashion
                  to go to see it' (<em>Letters</em>, VI, 156). Chantrey himself
                  would come to regard the bust as his masterpiece.</td>

            <p>The original bust in plaster was completed in 1820. It is now
              in the <a href="http://www.ashmolean.org/">Ashmolean Museum</a> at
              Oxford University. According to Chantrey's ledger, five marble
              replicas were made, the most famous of which is that at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>.
              Begun in 1820, the Abbotsford bust was not completed until 1821,
              when Scott gave Chantrey a number of further sittings in the course
              of two visits to London. The Abbotsford bust remained in Chantrey's
              studio from 1821 until 1828, and all the engravings and medallions
              representing Chantrey's bust would appear to derive from it. Chantrey
              offered the bust as a gift to Lady Scott while visiting Abbotsford
              in May 1825. He was a welcome guest. Scott judged him 'a right
              good John Bull blunt &amp; honest &amp; open without any of the
              nonsensical affectation so common among artists' (to Jane Jobson
              Scott, 16 May 1825, <em>Letters</em>, IX, 115) and recorded with
              amusement how he had 'killd a salmon at which he was almost mad
              with joy' (to Charles Scott, 13 May 1825, <em>Letters</em>, IX,
              113). It was not until June 1828, however, that the bust was dispatched
              to Scotland.<ho> According to Chantrey 'about forty-five casts'
              of the Abbotsford bust were made for Scott's friends and admirers.
              In addition, pirate versions were circulated 'to the extent of
              thousands'.</p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="59%">A second marble replica of the bust (now at <a href="http://www.stratfield-saye.co.uk/">Stratford
                    Saye</a>) was ordered by the Duke of Wellington in September
                    1821. A third marble version was made for Chantrey's own
                    studio in 1828, for which Scott gave further sittings, and
                    which shows minor changes in the configuration of the face.
                    This version was purchased by Sir Robert Peel in 1838 and
                    is now in a private collection. Describing the bust to Peel,
                    Chantrey claimed that 'the expression is more serious than
                    in the two former Busts, and the marks of age <em>more</em> than
                    eight years deeper'. As a result, Lockhart in his survey
                    of portraits of Scott, felt that it possessed 'the character
                    of a second original' (VII, 429). Francis Russell, however,
                    in his <em>Portraits of Sir Walter Scott</em> (1987), is
                    convinced that Chantrey's account exaggerates the differences.
                    He judges the changes to Scott's face 'slight' and argues
                    that the bust differs most significantly from other versions
                    in the set of the plaid. The remaining two replicas were
                    ordered by Archibald M'Lellan in 1836 and Robert Vernon in
                    1838, and are now in <a href="http://www.glasgowmuseums.com/venue/index.cfm?venueid=4">Kelvingrove

            <p>In addition to the many casts and copies, Abbotsford bust inspired
              a significant number of medallions, intaglios, engravings, lithographs,
              and other derived works. Francis Russell lists medallions by W.
              Bain (1822-23), William Wyon (1824), A. J. Stothard (1826), Henry
              Weekes (1838), and E. Halliday (1840). The medallions themselves
              inspired engravings by J. Bate (after Stothard, n.d.), Edward Lacey
              (after Stothard, 1832), and <a href="../engravers/collas.html">Achille
              Collas</a> (after Weekes, 1838). As for engravings made directly
              from the Abbotsford bust, Russell records works by <a href="../engravers/thomson.html">James
              Thomson</a> (1831), <a href="../engravers/shaw.html">William Holl
              the Younger</a> (1837), and <a href="../engravers/shaw.html">George
              Baird Shaw</a> (1839). Further derived engravings were published
              by Charles Picart (1824), J. T. Wedgewood (1827), and Degobert
              (n.d.). In unpublished research held by Edinburgh University Library's <a href="../../corson.html">Corson

            <p>So widely recognised is Chantrey's likeness of Scott, that when
              in 1871 the Royal Mail commissioned Rosalind Dease to design a
              stamp to mark the bicentenary of the writer's birth, she based
