            <p><img src="graphics/geddes.jpg" alt="Andrew Geddes, self-portrait (1812) engraved by J. Le Conte (1875)" width="268" height="317" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The
              painter and etcher Andrew Geddes was born on 5 April 1783 in Edinburgh,
              where his father was Deputy-Auditor of Excise and a keen connoisseur
              and collector of art. Although Geddes showed early talent for art,
              he was placed as a clerk in his father's office after completing
              a classical education at the High School and University of Edinburgh.
              It was only after his father's death in 1803 that Geddes took the
              step of devoting himself entirely to art. In 1806, he travelled
              to London to study at the Royal Academy and, in the same year,
              exhibited his first painting 'St. John in the Wilderness'. Among
              his colleagues at the Academy was his countryman <a href="wilkie.html">David
              Wilkie</a>, who became a close friend and with whom he would be
              strongly associated in the public mind. As a mature student, Geddes
              felt that he could not afford, financially or professionally, to
              complete a full ten-year course of studies at the Academy and in
              1810, he returned to Edinburgh and opened a studio in York Place.
              He was soon in constant demand as a portrait-painter, portraying,
              amongst others, the novelist Henry Mackenzie, the publisher and
              bookseller Archibald Constable, the antiquary George Chalmers,
              and his fellows artists Wilkie, William Allan, Alexander Nasmyth,
              Benjamin Robert Haydon, Archibald Skirving, Anthony Stewart, the
              Revd. John Thomson, Andrew Wilson, George Sanders, and Nathaniel
              Plimer (his future father-in-law).</p>

                <td width="59%">When travel to the Continent became possible
                  in 1814, Geddes visited Paris and studied the great works of
                  Veronese, Titian, Giorgione, Correggio, Jordaens, and Rubens
                  that Napoleon's armies had looted from conquered territories.
                  Rubens's <em>The Assumption of the Virgin</em> was the inspiration
                  for Geddes's only recorded commission as a religious artist,
                  an <em>Ascension</em> painted in 1815 for the Church of <a href="http://www.stjamesgarlickhythe.org.uk/">St
                  James's Garlickhythe</a> in London. In February 1818 Geddes
                  was among the artists chosen to make a record of the newly
                  rediscovered Regalia of Scotland. Having completed two drawings
                  for the official report into the rediscovery, Geddes began
                  work on a massive group-portrait depicting the moment at which
                  the
                  twenty-four Royal Commissioners opened the chest containing
                  the Regalia. Among his studies for this composition was a <a href="../paintings/geddes.html">portrait</a> of
                  Scott (1818). <a href="../paintings/regalia.html"><em>The Discovery
                  of the Regalia of Scotland</em> </a>was finally displayed at
                  the Royal Academy in 1821 and subsequently formed the centrepiece
                  of a collected exhibition of his work in Edinburgh in the same
                  year. The piece, however, found no buyer and subsequently perished
                  through neglect.</td>

            <p>Although frustrated in his attempts to secure election to Associate
              membership of the Royal Academy, Geddes transferred his studio
              to London and continued to attract prestigious commissions throughout
              the 1820s, notably a massive portrait of Frederick August, Duke
              of York. In 1826, following Wilkie's example, he published a limited
              edition of portfolios of etchings. Geddes is now perhaps more highly
              regarded as an etcher than as a painter and has been credited with
              heralding an etching revival. His collected etchings -- including
              portraits such as <em>Mrs Geddes, the Artist's Mother</em>, <em>George
              Chalmers</em>, and <em>Sir William Allan</em>, and landscapes like <em>The
              Field of Bannockburn and the Bore Stone</em> and <em>Peckham Rye</em> --
              were published by the collector <a href="http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/about/bgallery/Gallery/records/eighteen/laing.html">David
              Laing</a> in 1875. </p>

            <p>Following Geddes's marriage to Adela Plimer (his future biographer)
              in 1827, he set out for a three-year sojourn in Italy and engaged
              in a lengthy study of the artists of the Venetian School. His decision
              to return to London in 1831 was partly prompted by the onset of
              consumption. On his way home, he made a stay in Munich to study
              the Rubens collections. Back in London, he was finally elected
              Associate member of the Academy in 1832. Throughout the 1830s,
              Geddes continued to exhibit portraits, landscapes, and subject
              paintings, the latter increasingly displaying literary and religious
              motifs. In 1839, he travelled to Holland to study Rembrandt whom
              he particularly admired as an etcher. Geddes suffered a renewed
              attack of consumption in spring 1844 but refused all medical assistance
              in his effort to complete his submissions to the annual exhibition
              of the Royal Academy. These included Geddes's only other Scott-related
              project: an imaginary portrait of Jenny Denison, Edith Bellenden's
              maidservant in<em> <a href="../../works/novels/mortality.html">The
              Tale of Old Mortality</a></em>. Geddes died in his wife's arms
              on 5 May 1844.</p>
