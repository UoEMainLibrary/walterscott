            <p><img src="graphics/raeburnself.jpg" alt="Sir Henry Raeburn, self-portrait engraved by George B. Shaw, 1835 (Corson P.6112)" width="234" height="300" hspace="10" align="right">The
              most prominent portrait painter of his day, Raeburn was born in
              the Stockbridge area of Edinburgh on 4 March 1756. He lost his
              father, a mill owner, at an early age, was raised by an older brother,
              and educated at Heriot's Hospital. In 1772 he was apprenticed to
              the jeweller James Gilliland but began painting water-colour miniatures
              of his friends. He soon attracted the attention of the city's leading
              portraitist, David Martin. With guidance from Martin, Raeburn turned
              to painting in oil and began to develop his personal style. In
              1778, he married a wealthy widow of independent means, whose dowry
              permitted him to devote himself entirely to painting. Through the
              marriage, he also acquired the Deanhaugh Estate in Stockbridge.
              He was later to purchase the neighbouring St. Bernard's estate
              and to amass a considerable fortune by feuing both for building
              the Stockbridge extension of Edinburgh's New Town. In 1784 he travelled
              to London where he met Sir Joshua Reynolds whose style was to exert
              a great influence upon him. On Reynolds's advice, he spent the
              following two years studying in Italy. Raeburn returned to Edinburgh
              in 1787, set up a studio in George Street, and rapidly established
              himself as the leading portraitist of Edinburgh society. He was
              to paint many of the most prominent Scots of the days, gradually
              developing from bust-sized figures to full length portraits. His
              reputation spread beyond Edinburgh and he became a member of the
              Royal Academy in 1815. He was knighted by King George IV during
              his visit to Scotland in 1822 and, shortly before his death in
              1823, was appointed His Majesty's Limner for Scotland. Alongside <a href="wilkie.html">Sir
              David Wilkie</a>, Raeburn is considered the founder of the 'Scottish
              School' of painting.</p>

                <td width="48%"><p>Raeburn painted over 700 portraits, including
                    four of Sir Walter Scott in <a href="../paintings/raeburn1808.html">1808</a>, <a href="../paintings/raeburn1809.html">1809</a>,

                    These are discussed on separate pages. Amongst Raeburn's
                    other most celebrated likenesses are those of Mrs James Campbell,
                    Sir John Sinclair, Lord Newton, and Alexander Adam. Today
                    he is perhaps best-known for his much reproduced image of <em>The
                    Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch</em>.
