            <h2><font color="#003366">Sir John Watson Gordon (1788-1864)</font></h2>
            <p>The portrait painter Sir John Watson Gordon was born in Edinburgh
              in 1788. He was the son of Captain James Watson of the Royal Artillery
              and a second cousin to Sir Walter Scott on Scott's mother's side.
              He was initially expected to follow in his father's footsteps but
              was too young, on completing his schooling, to take up a cadetship
              in the Military Academy at Woolwich. As he showed a predilection
              for the arts, he was enrolled in the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh
              where he received drawing lessons from John Graham. He received
              less formal tuition in painting from his uncle George Watson, a
              prominent portrait-painter, and from <a href="raeburn.html">Sir
              Henry Raeburn</a>, a family friend. He rapidly made such progress
              as to persuade his family to let him follow an artistic career. </p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="55%">Watson-Gordon is today best-known as a portraitist,
                  but his earliest works were genre scenes, including, in 1808,
                  a scene from Scott's <em><a href="../../works/poetry/minstrel.html">The
                  Lay of the Last Minstrel</a></em> and, 1821, <em>Meg Merrilies,
                  Ellangowan, and his Groom</em>, a scene from <a href="../../works/novels/mannering.html"><em>Guy
                  Mannering</em></a>. He continued to paint religious and genre
                  pictures but after 1821 concentrated on portraiture, and, following
                  the death of Raeburn (by whom he was deeply influenced), rose
                  to become the leading portrait painter in Scotland. In 1826,
                  he assumed the name Watson Gordon (sometimes hyphenated) in
                  order to avoid confusion with his uncle and with his cousin
                  William Stewart Watson, another distinguished Edinburgh-based
                  painter. In the same year, he was a founding member of the <a href="http://www.royalscottishacademy.org/">Royal
                  Scottish Academy</a> in 1826 and displayed work at their annual
                  exhibitions from 1830 until 1865. From 1827, he also exhibited
                  at the <a href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/">Royal Academy</a> in
                  London, achieving both critical and popular acclaim, and attracting
                  many English sitters to his Edinburgh studio. </td>

            <p>Watson Gordon was particularly successful in portraying the artists,
              literati, and intellectuals of his day, including a celebrated
              set of paintings of the prime movers behind <em>Blackwood's Magazine</em>:
              J. G. Lockhart (1821), John Wilson (1829 and 1858), and James Hogg
              (1830). Other celebrated portraits of writers and thinkers include
              Lady Nairne (1815), Thomas Chalmers (1838), Sir Archibald Alison
              (1839), and Thomas de Quincey (1846). In the first two decades
              of his prime as a portrait-painter, Watson Gordon's style was rich
              and varied in colour. Particularly fine examples are the likenesses
              of the Earl of Dalhousie (1833) in the Archers' Hall, Edinburgh,
              of and Lord President Hope (1832) in the <a href="http://www.thewss.co.uk/index.asp?cat=Library">Signet
              Library</a>.</p>

            <p>Gradually, however, he adopted a more spartan style, using muted
              colour and a cool light. Masterpieces of this final phase of his
              career include Principal John Lee (1847), David Cox (1855), Henry
              Houldsworth of Coltness (1856), and Roderick Gray, Provost of Peterhead
              (1852), for which he was a awarded a gold medal at the Paris Universal
              Exhibition of 1855. In 1850 Watson Gordon succeeded Sir William
              Allan as President of the Royal Scottish Academy. Shortly afterwards
              he was knighted and appointed Royal Limner (i.e. court painter)
              for Scotland. Watson Gordon died suddenly in Edinburgh on 1 June
              1864. In his memory his brother and sister endowed the Watson-Gordon
              Professorship of Fine Art at <a href="http://www.arthistory.ed.ac.uk/index.html">Edinburgh
              University</a> in 1879, the first chair in art history in Britain.</p>
            <p>Watson Gordon painted four likenesses of Sir Walter Scott: complete
              portraits in <a href="../paintings/gordon1820.html">1820</a> and <a href="../paintings/gordon1830.html">1830</a>,
              an <a href="../paintings/gordonunfin.html">unfinished portrait</a> dating
              probably from 1830, and the posthumous <em><a href="../paintings/gordoncastlest.html">Sir
              Walter Scott in his Study at Castle Street</a></em>. Scott also
              commissioned from Watson Gordon a portrait of his mother, Anne
              Rutherford (see <a href="../../biography/origins.html">Family Background</a>)
              and a set of miniature portraits of his family for the travelling
              case of his soldier-son Walter. In addition, be made copies of
              the <a href="../paintings/raeburn1809.html">1809</a> and <a href="../paintings/raeburn1823.html">1823</a> portraits
              of Scott by Sir Henry Raeburn for James Skene of Rubislaw (ca.
              1829) and Hugh Scott of Draycott (1825) respectively. </p>
            <p>Watson Gordon's 1830 portrait of Scott was commissioned by Robert
              Cadell in order to be engraved for the 'Magnum Opus' edition of
              the Waverley Novels. Watson Gordon made two further contributions
              to the 'Magnum Opus': the frontispiece and title-page vignette
              of vol. XXXVIII (<em><a href="../../biography/origins.html">The
              Talisman</a></em>) (1832) of the Waverley Novels and a portrait
              of Francis Jeffrey for vol. XVII of the Prose Works (1835).</p>
