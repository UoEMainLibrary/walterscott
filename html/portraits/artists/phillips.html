            <h2><font color="#003366">Thomas Phillips (1770-1845)</font></h2>
            <p>The portrait-painter Thomas Phillips was
                born in Dudley, Warwickshire, on 18 October 1770. He was apprenticed
                to the Birmingham glass-painter Francis Eginton then in 1790
              came to London with a letter of recommendation for Benjamin West.
              West found him employment working on the painted-glass
              windows of St.
              George's
              Chapel, Windsor.
              In
              1791
              he began studying
                at the Royal Academy (of which West was co-founder) and, having
              experimented with landscapes and historical subjects, discovered
              a talent
              for
              portrait-painting.
              Here he had to compete in an over-populated field where Lawrence,
                Hoppner, Beechey, Owen, and Shee already commanded considerable
                clienteles. By the turn of the century, though, Phillips
                was attracting lucrative sitters and a rapid advance in his fortune
              saw him paint the the
              Prince of Wales in 1806. In the following years he portrayed many
              of the celebrities of the day including the poets
              Blake, Byron, Coleridge, Crabbe, Thomas Campbell, Rogers, and Southey,
              the scientists Banks, Buckland,
              Dalton, Davy, Faraday, and Somerville, the explorers Clapperton,
              Denham, Franklin, and Parry, and the artists <a href="chantrey.html">Chantrey</a> and <a href="wilkie.html">Wilkie</a>.
              He was elected an
              associate
              of the
              Royal
              Academy
              in
            1804, a full member in 1808, and, in 1825, the Academy's professor
              of painting. As well as authoring many occasional essays on the
              Fine Arts, he published his <em>Lectures
              on the History and Principles of Painting</em> in 1833. A fellow
              of the Royal Society
              and Society of Antiquaries and founding member of the Artists'
              General Benevolent Institution, Phillips died in London on 20 April
            1845. </p>

            <p>In addition to  his portrait of Scott
              for John Murray, Thomas Phillips painted a number of subjects inspired
              by the writer's
              works. In 1833, he exhibited a portrait of Rebecca (<em><a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html">Ivanhoe</a></em>)
              at the Royal Academy, followed by Anna Comnena (<a href="../../works/novels/robert.html"><em>Count
              Robert of Paris</em></a>)
              in 1835 and Flora MacIvor (<em><a href="../../works/novels/waverley.html">Waverley</a></em>)
              in 1839. Also in the 1830s, he produced a portrait of Clara de
              Clare (<em><a href="../../works/poetry/marmion.html">Marmion</a></em>)
              which was engraved for <em>Illustrations, Landscape,
              Historical, and Antiquarian, to the Poetical Works of Sir Walter
            Scott, Bart. </em>(click on thumbnail below).</p>
