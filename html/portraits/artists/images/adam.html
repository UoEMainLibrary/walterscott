              <p align="center">Alexander Adam (1741-1809) was Rector of the
                High School of Edinburgh where Sir Walter Scott was educated
                from 1779 to 1783. One of the most innovative educators of his
                age,
                he
                sought
                to instill in his pupils not only a grasp of grammar but a sensitivity
                to literary language. With Adam's encouragement, the young Scott
                translated Horace and Virgil into English verse and made his
                first attempts at original composition. The original portrait
                was painted by Raeburn ca. 1808.</p>
