                  Holl the Younger</a> after <a href="../geddes.html">Andrew

              <p align="center"><a href="../wilkie.html">Sir David
                  Wilkie</a> painted Scott on three occasions:
                in the group compositions <em><a href="../../paintings/abbotfam.html">The
                Abbotsford Family</a></em> (1817)
                and <em><a href="../../paintings/holyrood.html">The Entrance
                of King George IV at Holyrood</a></em> (1829) and in
                an
                individual <a href="../../paintings/wilkie.html">portrait</a> (1824).
                He also left a sketch of <em><a href="../../paintings/coursing.html">Sir
                Walter Scott Coursing</a></em> (1817 or
                1824). Besides painting a number of
                pictures inspired by Scott's fiction, Wilkie contributed
                illustrations to the Magnum Opus edition of the Waverley Novels.
                Scott was a great admirer of Wilkie's work. In chapter 10 of
                <em><a href="../../../works/novels/antiquary.html">The Antiquary</a></em> (1816), he describes Steenie Mucklebackit's mourning
                family as presenting 'a scene which our Wilkie alone could have
                painted, with that exquisite feeling of nature that characterises
                his enchanting productions'. The original portrait of Wilkie
              by Andrew Geddes was painted in 1821.</p>
