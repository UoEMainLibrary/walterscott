              <p align="center">In the preface to <em><a href="../../../works/novels/monastery.html">The
                    Monastery</a></em>, Scott saluted
                the engineer and inventor James Watt as 'the man whose genius
                discovered the means of multiplying our national resources to
                a degree perhaps even beyond his own stupendous powers of calculation
                and combination; bringing the treasures of the abyss to the summit
                of the earth -- giving the feeble arm of man the momentum of
                    an Afrite -- commanding manufactures to arise, as the rod
                    of the prophet
                produced water in the desert -- affording the means of dispensing
                with that time and tide which wait for no man, and of sailing
                without that wind which defied the commands and threats of Xerxes
                himself'. He was, moreover, 'one of the best and kindest of
                human beings'. <br>
