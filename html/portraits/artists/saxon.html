            <h2><font color="#003366">James Saxon (fl. 1795-1828)</font></h2>
            <p>Relatively little is known of the life and career of James Saxon.
              He was born in Manchester and practised there as a portrait-painter
              until 1797. He then transferred his business to London where he
              had previously exhibited at the Royal Academy. In or around 1803
              he came to work in Scotland, producing portraits of, amongst others,
              Scott and the naval strategist John Clerk of Eldin. Shortly afterwards,
              he went to St Petersburg where he practised successfully (and prolifically)
              for several years. On his return to Britain, he spent a short time
              in Glasgow, before settling in London. Saxon exhibited regularly
              at the Royal Academy between 1795 and 1817. Most reference works
              give his date of death as 1816 or 1817. The National Portrait Gallery,
              however, has found evidence to suggest that he was still alive
              in 1828. The National Portrait Gallery holds a portrait of Sir
              Richard Phillips by Saxon, together with two engravings by Charles
              Turner after a portrait of William Fordyce Mavor by Saxon. Images
              can be viewed at the Gallery's <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/">website</a>.</p>

                  of Saxon's portrait of John Clerk of Eldin prepared for <em>The
                  Scott Gallery</em> (1903), a collection of portraits of Scott,
                  his family, friends, and contemporaries, and of historical
                  figures portrayed in his work. Clerk was the father of Scott's
                  lifelong friend and fellow advocate William Clerk (often thought
                  to be the prototype of Darsie Latimer in <em><a href="../../works/novels/redgaun.html">Redgauntlet</a></em>).
                  As a small child, Scott had once witnessed John Clerk demonstrate
                  his celebrated manoeuvre of dividing the line in naval battle
                  to a group of men by means of cork models. Scott had picked
                  up one of the models and been good-naturedly scolded by Clerk
                  when he found he was missing a ship vital to his demonstration.
                  Scott is though to have incorporated some of Clerk's eccentricities
                  into the character of Jonathan Oldbuck, hero of <em><a href="../../works/novels/antiquary.html">The
