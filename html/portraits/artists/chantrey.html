                Chantrey was born at Norton, Derbyshire, on 7 April
                1781.
                The
                son of
                a
                tenant farmer
                and carpenter, he received a rudimentary education at the village
                school. Initially apprenticed to a carver in nearby Sheffield,
              he broke his indentures in
              1802 to pursue a career as a portrait painter. With encouragement
              from the mezzotintist J. R. Smith, he spent the next five years
              moving between Sheffield and London, working as a largely self-taught
              portraitist and modeller
              of busts. He was awarded his first public commission
                in 1805, carving a bust of the Revd James Wilkinson, vicar of
              Sheffield. This, his first work in marble, won him immediate local
              fame. Seeking
                perhaps to hone his skills, Chantrey attended the Royal Academy
              Schools in 1807 but never registered as a student. At around this
              point, Chantrey abandoned painting entirely in order to concentrate
              on sculpture. His sole exhibit at the academy in 1808, a bust of <em>Satan</em>,
              resulted in a commission to carve plaster busts of four naval heroes,
              admirals
              Duncan, Howe,
              Nelson, and St Vincent, for Alexander Daniel's additions to the
              Queen's House. Gradually Chantrey's fame spread in London. In 1809
              he was commissioned to carve a bust of <em>George III</em>, for which the
              king gave sittings, and in 1810 he exhibited at the Royal Academy
              his first bust of a national leader, <em>William Pitt</em>. </p>

              <tr>
                <td width="60%">The year 1811 saw Chantrey gain widespread recognition. In
                  April, the City of London awarded him the commission for a
                  statue of <em>George III</em> for the Guildhall. Six plaster
                  busts in a new, realistic style, exhibited at the Royal Academy,
                  including <em>Benjamin West</em>, <em>John Raphael Smith</em>, <em>John
                  Horne Tooke</em>, and <em>Sir Francis Burdett</em>, were a
                  triumph. In the following years, Chantrey was much sought-after
                  as a portrait sculptor, prized for his ability to capture the
                  intimate character of his subjects and yet to portray them
                  as men of the age in which they lived. His sitters included
                  artists, writers, medical men, military heroes, scientists,
                  and industrialists. Particularly outstanding works of this
                  period include busts of <em>James Watt</em> (1815) and <em><a href="../paintings/chantrey.html">Sir
                  Walter Scott</a></em><a href="../paintings/chantrey.html"> (1820)</a>, and statues of <em>Major-General
                  Hoghton</em> (1812), <em>The Robinson Children</em> (1815),
                  and, for Parliament House, Edinburgh, <em>Lord President Robert
                  Blair</em> (1812) and <em>Robert Dundas of Arniston</em> (1820).
                  Sir Walter Scott judged the latter 'as like the original subjects
                  as marble can do to flesh &amp; blood' (to Charles William
                  Henry Scott, 4th Duke of Buccleuch, 14 November 1818, <em>Letters</em>,
                V, 217).</td>

                visited Italy in 1819, perhaps in response to pressure from patrons
                to attempt ideal, poetic figures, but he continued
                to specialize in contemporary portraiture. From the early 1820s
                until his death, Chantrey was the portrait sculptor of choice
              for wealthy, institutional, or public patrons. His masterpieces
              of
                these years include busts of <em>George IV</em> (1822), <em>Robert
                Southey</em> (1828), <em>Sir Jeffry Wyatville</em> (1837), and <em>Queen
                Victoria</em> (1838),
                and statues of <em>James
                Watt</em> (1820) and <em>Revd Reginald Heber</em> (1828). He
                was knighted by William IV in 1835 and his popularity remained
                undimmed
                until his sudden death in London on 25 November
                1841.
                He bequeathed
                a legacy to the Royal Academy to support the purchase of British
                paintings and sculpture and to create a national collection of
                British art. A victim of the low esteem in which portrait sculpture
                has
                traditionally been held, Chantrey long suffered from critical
                neglect. He is now, however, increasingly recognized outstanding
                British
                sculptor of the early nineteenth century and as the creator of
                lasting images
                of
                some
                of the most
                important
                  figures
                  in British
            history.</p>
