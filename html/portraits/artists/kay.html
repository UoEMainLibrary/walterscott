            <h2><font color="#003366">John Kay (1742-1826)</font></h2>
            <p>The miniature-painter and caricaturist John Kay was born near
              Dalkeith, Midlothian, in April 1742. The son of a mason, he was
              apprenticed at the age of thirteen to George Heriot, a barber in
              Dalkeith. Six years later, he moved to Edinburgh where he continued
              to work as a journeyman barber. In 1771 he was enrolled a member
              of the Society of Surgeon-Barbers and set up in business on his
              own account. In his spare time, however, he began to produce highly
              original portrait sketches and caricatures of Edinburgh characters,
              despite having received no formal training in drawing. He attracted
              the patronage of William Nisbet of Dirleton, who settled an annuity
              upon him, and in 1785 was finally able to give up his trade for
              art. Kay opened a shop in Parliament Close where he sold his etchings.
              From 1784 to 1822 he is calculated to have etched nearly nine hundred
              plates portraying many of the most notable Scotsmen of the day.
              His etching of Adam Smith is the only surviving portrait made during
            the economist's lifetime. </p>

            <p><font color="#003366"></font>Many of Kay's more satirical prints
              were bought by his subjects themselves with the express purpose
              of destroying them. On at least one occasion, he was 'cudgelled'
              and, on another, unsuccessfully prosecuted. In 1792 he decided
              to publish some of his work in book form and prepared a brief biographical
              sketch which supplies most of the few details that are known of
              his life. The project, however, remained unrealized, and it was
              not until after his death that a collection of 340 of his etchings
              was published in 1837-38. Kay contributed portraits to the annual
              exhibitions of the Edinburgh Associated Artists from 1811 to 1816,
              and to the 1822 exhibition of the Institution for the Encouragement
              of the Fine Arts in Scotland. He died in Edinburgh on 21 February
              1826. His etchings consitute an unparallelled chronicle of Edinburgh
              life at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
