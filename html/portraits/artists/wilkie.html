            <h2><font color="#003366">Sir David Wilkie (1785-1841)</font></h2>
            <p><img src="graphics/wilkieport.jpg" alt="Sir David Wilkie, engraved by William Holl after Andrew Geddes (Corson: Scott Papers/99)" width="240" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The
              son of a minister, David Wilkie was born in Cults, Fife, on 18
              November 1785. He attended the Trustees' Academy of Design in Edinburgh
              from 1799 to 1804 and, upon completing his studies, moved to London
              in 1805 and gained admission at the Royal Academy where his contemporaries
              included <a href="geddes.html">Andrew Geddes</a>. Here he encountered
              almost immediate success when the first of his realistic portrayals
              of rural life, <em>The Village Politicians,</em> was unveiled at
              the Academy's 1806 exhibition. A string of equally acclaimed paintings
              in the same vein followed, including <em>The Blind Fiddler</em> (1807), <em>The
              Card Players</em>, <a href="../engravers/images/raimbachwilkie.html"><em>The
              Rent Day</em></a> (both 1808), <em>The Village Festival</em> (1812), <em>Blind
              Man's Buff</em> (1813), <em>Distraining for Rent</em> (1815), <em>The
              Scotch, or Penny Wedding</em> (1818). The homely simplicity of
              Wilkie's compositions stood in marked contrast to the artificial
              and contrived nature of much contemporary genre painting and signalled
              a turning-point in British Art. Together with <a href="raeburn.html">Sir
              Henry Raeburn</a>, he was hailed as the founder of a new 'Scottish
              School' of painting. Wilkie collaborated on popular print-versions
              of his paintings with <a href="../engravers/raimbach.html">Abraham
              Raimbach</a> which brought both men considerable financial success.
              Public acclaim was accompanied by professional recognition. Wilkie
              was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1809, when he
              was only 24 years old, and a full member in 1812. Following the
              death of Raeburn in 1823, he was appointed His Majesty's Limner
              for Scotland.</p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="59%">Wilkie's always frail health was badly shaken
                  in 1825 by a series of family bereavements and by the financial
                  collapse of his printsellers Heath &amp; Robinson. A long stay
                  in Italy permitted him to convalesce, followed by a visit to
                  Spain which would prove an artistic revelation. Velasquez and
                  Murillo now displaced the Dutch masters as his chief mentors
                  and in the Royal Academy's 1829 exhibition he unveiled eight
                  new works painted under their influence, including <em>The
                  Maid of Saragossa</em>, <em>The Pifferari</em>, and <em>The
                  Guerrilla Council of War</em>. The Spanish style continued
                  to inform his most important later works such as <em>Preaching
                  of Knox before the Lords of the Congregation</em> (1832), <em>The
                  First Earring</em> (1835), <em>Napoleon and the Pope in Conference
                  at Fontainebleau</em> (1836), and <em>Sir David Baird Discovering
                  the Body of Tippoo Saib </em>(1839). He succeeded Sir Thomas
                  Lawrence as Painter-in-Ordinary to the King in 1830 and was
                  knighted in 1836. In 1840 he travelled to Constantinople, Jerusalem,
                  and Alexandria (where he painted the Pacha Mehemet Ali). He
                  died suddenly on the return journey and was buried at sea near
                  Gibraltar, an event commemorated in one of J.M.W. Turner's
                  most celebrated paintings.</td>

            <p>Wilkie portrayed Scott in three paintings and one drawing. The
              former include two group compositions <em>The <a href="../paintings/abbotfam.html">Abbotsford
              Family</a></em> (1817) and <em><a href="../paintings/holyrood.html">The
              Entrance of King George IV at Holyrood</a></em> (1829), and an
              individual portrait (<a href="../paintings/wilkie.html">1824</a>).
              The latter is a sketch of <a href="../paintings/coursing.html"><em>Sir
              Walter Scott Coursing</em></a>. These are discussed on separate
              pages which also provide details of Wilkie's relations with Scott. </p>
            <p>In addition to the portraits, Wilkie painted a number of works
              illustrative of or inspired by Scott's novels. In 1829, he agreed
              to provide sketches to be engraved for the Magnum Opus edition
              of the Waverley Novels. In a letter of thanks, Scott wrote that
              'you, who are beset by the sin of modesty, will be least of all
              men aware what a tower of strength your name must be in a work
              of this nature, which, if successful, will go a great way to counterbalance
              some very severe losses which I sustained, two or three years since,
              by the failure of Constable's house, and Hurst and Robinson's,
              in London' (<em>Letters</em>, XI, 73). He was anxious, however,
              lest Wilkie jeopardize his health through working to a deadline.
              Wilkie, in fact, may be supposed to have been peculiarly sympathetic
              to Scott's plight (see <a href="http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/finance.html#1826">Financial
              Hardship</a>) as he too had suffered by the collapse of Hurst &amp; Robinson.
              He assured Scott that he would be delighted to 'assist in the illustration
              of the great work which we all hope may lighten or remove that
              load of troubles by which your noble spirit is at this time beset'.
              He was merely repaying 'a debt of obligation which you yourself
              have laid upon me when, with an unseen hand in the <em>Antiquary</em>,
              you took me up, and claimed me, the humble painter of domestic
              sorrow, as your countryman' (Letter of 10 January 1829, <em>The
              Private Letter-Books of Sir Walter Scott</em>, p. 250). Here Wilkie
              is referring to a passage in chapter 10 of <em><a href="../../works/novels/antiquary.html">The
              Antiquary</a></em> (1816), where Steenie Mucklebackit's mourning
              family present 'a scene which our Wilkie alone could have painted,
              with that exquisite feeling of nature that characterises his enchanting
              productions'. Wilkie added that he was already planning an illustration
              of Henry Morton's arrest in <a href="../../works/novels/mortality.html"><em>Old
              Mortality</em></a>, which would permit him to depict Morton's man-servant
              Cuddie Headrigg and his mother 'of all your creations my favourite'.</p>

            <p>This illustration appeared in the Magnum Opus as <em>Scene at
                Milnwood</em> (click on thumbnail, above) along with a title
                page vignette for <em>Old Mortality</em> and illustrations of <em>Henry
                Wardon before the Sub-Prior</em> for <em><a href="../../works/novels/monastery.html">The
                Monastery</a></em> and <em>Julian Peveril and Sir Geoffrey Hudson</em> <em>in
                Newgate</em> for <em><a href="../../works/novels/peak.html">Peveril
                of the Peak</a></em>. These were republished in the Abbotsford
                Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842), together with two further
                illustrations for <em>Old Mortality</em> (<em>Tent Preaching
                at Kilmartin</em> and C<em>uddie Headrigg's Cottage</em>: possibly
                unused sketches for the Magnum Opus) and one for <a href="../../works/novels/abbot.html"><em>The
                Abbot</em></a> (<em>Roland Graeme and Catherine Seton before
                Queen Mary</em>). The Abbotsford Edition also contained engravings
                of Wilkie's <em>The Abbotsford Family</em> and <em>Sir Walter
                Scott Coursing</em> and of four previously exhibited paintings
                by Wilkie depicting people, places, or scenes featured in Scott's
                novels: <em>Gustavus Adolphus</em> for <a href="../../works/novels/montrose.html"><em>A
                Legend of Montrose</em></a>, <em>D&uuml;rrenstein on the Danube</em> for <a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html"><em>Ivanhoe</em></a>, <em>The
                Escape from Lochleven Castle</em> for <em>The Abbot</em>, and <em>The
                Convent of the Holy Brethren</em> and <em>Distant View of the
                Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem</em> for <a href="../../works/novels/talisman.html"><em>The
                Talisman</em></a>. Although these last were not originally designed
                to illustrate a specific edition of Scott, they are likely to
                have been inspired by a reading or recollection of Scott. It
                has similarly been suggested that Wilkie's T<em>he Reading of
                a Will</em> (1820) and <em>Napoleon and the Pope in Conference
                at Fontainebleau</em> (1836) were inspired by passages in <a href="../../works/novels/mannering.html"><em>Guy
                Mannering</em></a> and Scott's <em><a href="../../works/prose/napoleon.html">The
                Life of Napoleon Buonaparte</a></em> respectively.</p>
