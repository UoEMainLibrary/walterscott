            <h2><font color="#003366">William Nicholson (1781-1844)</font></h2>
            <p>The portrait-painter and etcher William Nicholson was born in
              Ovingham-on-Tyne, Northumberland, on Christmas Day 1781. His family
              transferred to Newcastle when his father was appointed Headmaster
              of the city's Grammar School. At an early age, though, Nicholson
              appears to have moved to Hull where he made his artistic debut,
              painting miniatures of officers garrisoned there. He was almost
              entirely self-taught, learning his craft through the close study
              of artworks in private and public galleries. He subsequently returned
              to Newcastle where he received many commissions to paint portraits
              of the old families of Northumberland. In 1808, he began to exhibit
              at the Royal Academy, continuing to do so until 1822. By 1814,
              Nicholson, whose mother was a Scot, had moved to Edinburgh where
              he set up as a miniaturist and painter in oils. Soon, however,
              he began to specialize in watercolour portraits. Early subjects
              included the actor Daniel Terry and the poet and novelist James
              Hogg. In 1818 he began to publish a series of <em>Portraits of
              Eminent Scotsmen</em>, etched from his
              own portraits and those of other painters. Besides Scott and Hogg,
              the subjects included the writers Robert Burns, John Wilson ('Christopher
              North'), and Lord Jeffrey, the painters <a href="raeburn.html">Sir
              Henry Raeburn</a>, the divines Alexander Carlyle and Alexander
              Cameron, the engineer James Watt, the architect John Playfair,
              and the song-collector and composer George Thomson.</p>

                    Maria Lamb and, in the same year, contributed to the first
                    modern exhibition of the Institution for the Encouragement
                    of the Arts in Scotland. In 1826 he was among the most active
                    founding members of the Scottish Academy of Painting, Sculpture,
                    and Architecture. At its first meeting he was elected secretary,
                    a position he held until 1830. He contributed to each of
                    the Academy's Exhibitions until his death by fever in 1844,
                    latterly specializing in genre, landscape, and coast subjects
                    rather than portraits.</p>

            <p>Nicholson painted three (possibly four) watercolour
                portraits of Scott in 1816-17 and etched a further portrait
                from his own design in 1817.
