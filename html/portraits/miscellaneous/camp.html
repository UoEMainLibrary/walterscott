            <h2><font color="#003366">Camp: Scott's Favourite Dog</font></h2>
            <p>Scott's bull terrier Camp features prominently in three early
              portraits of the author by James Saxon (<a href="../paintings/saxon.html">1805</a>)
                and Sir Henry Raeburn (<a href="../paintings/raeburn1808.html">1808</a> and <a href="../paintings/raeburn1809.html">1809</a>). In a letter of 11 March
              1828 to the bookseller John Stevenson, Scott supplies the following
              biography and character-sketch to accompany a picture of Camp by
              the Edinburgh animal-painter James Howe (now apparently lost):</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong><img src="graphics/camp1.jpg" alt="Extract from Charles Heath's engraving of Raeburn's 1808 portrait of Scott (Corson P.4488)" width="300" height="188" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><font color="#003366">Camp was got by a black and tan English terrier calld
                    [sic] Doctor the property of Mr. Storie, Farrier in Rose Street
                    about 1800 out
                  of a thorough-bred English brindled bull-bitch the property of
                  Mr. John Adams of the Riding School Adjutant to the Royal Edinburgh
                    Volunteer cavalry. He was of great strength
    and very handsome extremely sagacious faithful and affectionate to the human
                    species and possessed
    of a great turn for gaiety and drollery. Although he was never taught any tricks
                    he learned some of his own accord and understood whatever was
                    said to him as well as any creature I ever
    saw. His great fault was an excessive ferocity towards his own species which
                    sometimes brought his Master and himself into dangerous scrapes.
    He used to accompany me always in coursing of which he was a great amateur and
                    was one of the best dogs
    for finding hares I ever saw though I have since had very fine terriers. At last
                    he met with an accident which gave him a sprain in the back from
                    which he never recovered after which he could
    not follow when I went out on horseback. The servant used to tell him when I
                    was seen coming home. I lived then at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Ashestiel</a> and
                    there were two ways by which I might return. If the servant
                    said, &quot; Camp,
                    your Master is coming back by the hill,&quot; he
    ran to meet me in that direction. If the lad said, &quot;by the ford,&quot; he
    came down to the bank of the river to welcome me ; nor did he ever make a
    mistake in the direction named. I might mention many instances of similar
    sagacity. He
    was seldom scolded or punished and except in his pugnacious propensities
    I never saw so manageable a dog. I could even keep him from fighting so long
    as I had
    my eye on him but if I quitted my vigilance for a moment he was sure to worry
    the dog nearest to him. </font></strong></p>
              <p><font color="#003366"><strong>He is painted in two portraits of his owner by Raeburn
                    </strong>[see image above]<strong> one at Dalkeith Palace
                    and one in my own possession. He lived till about twelve
                    years old and might
                  have lived longer
                  but for
                    the
      severe exercise which he had taken when young and a considerable disposition
      to voracity especially where animal food was to be come by. I could add
                  a number of curious anecdotes of his sagacity but they are
                  connected with a family loss
      since sustained and are painful to recollect or detail. There is enough
                  to illustrate Mr Stevensons picture which was painted by Mr
                  Howe
                    then a painter of animals of some merit. </strong></font></p>

                    his chest and broadness of his paws made him a capital water-dog

                  shoot wild ducks&#8212;which was not often&#8212;an excellent

                <td width="50%">Scott appears to have acquired Camp around the time of his
                  marriage in 1797 (see <a href="../../biography/marriage.html">Williamina,
                  Charlotte and Marriage</a>). Writing to Charles Kirpatrick
                  Sharpe, on 3 March 1809, Scott writes that 'the poor old fellow
                  began the world (as they say) along with my wife and I at our
                  marriage, and since that time has almost never been from the
                  side of one or other of us' (<em>Letters</em>, II, 172-73).
                  J.G. Lockhart describes Camp as 'the constant parlour dog [..]
                  naturally very fierce, but gentle as a lamb among the children'.
                  Scott, he recalls, always talked to Camp as if he understood
                  what was said -- and the animal certainly did understand not
                  a little of it; in particular, it seemed as if he perfectly
                  comprehended on all occasions that his master considered him
                as a sensible and steady friend' (II, 64).</td>

            </table>            <p>The death of Camp is frequently alluded to
              in Scott's letters. To Richard Heber, he confesses in a letter
              of 10 March
              1809, 'I was rather more grieved than philosophy admits of &amp; he
              has made a sort of blank which nothing will fill up for a long
            while' (<em>Letters</em>, XII, 311). Lockhart writes:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p> <font color="#003366"><strong>He died about January 1809 and was buried
                  in a fine moon-light night, in the little garden behind the house
                  in <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Castle
                  Street</a>, immediately opposite to the window at which Scott
                  usually sat writing. My wife [Scott's daughter Sophia] tells
                  me that she
                  remembers the whole family standing in tears about the grave,
                  as her father
                  himself
                  smoothed
                  down the turf above Camp with the saddest expression of face
                  she had ever seen in him. He had been engaged to dine abroad
                  that day,
                  but apologized on account of 'the death of a dear old friend;'
                  and Mr Macdonald Buchanan was not at all surprised that he should
                have done so, when it came out next morning that Camp was no more.</strong></font><strong> </strong>(II, 248)</p>
            </blockquote>            
            <p>Sending an engraving of the Raeburn portrait to Lady Abercorn
              on 25 February 1811, Scott recalls that 'my friends wrote as many
              elegies for [Camp] in different languages as ever were poured forth
              by Oxford or Cambridge on the
              death of a crowned head'. He had been sent poems to Camp's memory
              in Latin, French, Italian, Greek, Hebrew, German, Arabic and 'Hindostanee'
              (<em>Letters</em>, II, 450).</p>
            <p>Shortly before Camp's death, Scott's friend John Christian Schetky
              portrayed him in a design based around Scott's coat-of-arms. An
              engraving by <a href="../engravers/jheath.html">James Heath</a> figured
              on the title-page of Schetky's <em>Illustrations
