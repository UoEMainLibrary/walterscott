                <td width="57%">The portrait and figure engraver William Holl
                  the Younger was born in February 1807 at Plaistow, Essex. He
                  was the eldest of the four sons of William Holl the Elder (c.
                  1771-1838) who taught him engraving, in stipple at first, but
                  later in line on steel. His first independent work was an engraving
                  of Thomas Cranmer made in May 1829 for Edmund Lodge's <em>Portraits
                  of Illustrious Personages</em>. Between 1829 and 1835 he executed
                  a series of further prints for the same publication after such
                  artists as van Loo, Holbein, Gerard, Vandyke, Lely, Kneller,
                  Mytens, Hoare Coates, and Copley. He went on to contribute
                  further portraits to William Jerdan's <em>National Portrait
                  Gallery</em> (1830-34) and to Chambers's <em>Biographical Dictionary
                  of Eminent Scotsmen</em> (1834). In collaboration with his
                  brother Francis Holl (1815-84), he engraved illustrations to
                  Finden's <em>Tableaux of National Character</em> (1837) and <em>Gallery
                  of Beauty</em> (1841) and to <em>The Land of Burns</em> (1840).
                  Another brother Charles Holl (c. 1810-82) assisted William
                  throughout his career, while his youngest brother Benjamin
                  (1808-84) was an important portrait and figure engraver in
                  his own right.</td>

            <p>Holl's major projects of the 1840s were engravings after William
              Powell Frith and E. Hawkes in illustration of the poems of Thomas
              Moore (<em>Beauties of Moore, </em>1840) and a series of scriptural
              engravings after artists as varied as Raphael, Rembrandt, Benjamin
              West and James Northcote for Blackie's <em>Imperial Family Bible</em> (1844)
              and John Kitto's <em>Gallery of Scripture Engravings</em> (1846-49).
              His later book work included portraits for the <em>Imperial Dictionary</em> (1861)
              and Thomas Baines's <em>Yorkshire Past and Present</em> (1871-77).
              In 1851 he engraved a large plate of <em>An Old English Merrymakin</em>g
              after Frith for the Art Union of London. Two further plates after
              the same artist followed: <em>The Village Pastor</em> and <em>The
              Gleaner and his Wife</em>. In the 1860s he was engaged on portraits
              of the Royal Family: the Prince and Princess of Wales after photographs
              by John Jabez Edwin Mayall (1863), Queen Victoria after Albert
              Graefle (1864), and Victoria with her grandson Prince Albert Victor
              after Jabez Hughes (1866). Between 1860 and 1871 Holl exhibited
              twenty-two engravings at the Royal Academy mostly after George
              Richmond. He also enjoyed a great popular success with his engravings
              of Richmond's portraits of members of Grillion's Club. Holl died
              after a long illness on 30 January 1871. </p>
