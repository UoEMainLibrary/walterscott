                <td width="52%">James Heath was born on 19 April 1757 in Newgate, London,
                  where his father worked as a book-binder. Following an apprenticeship
                  to the engraver Joseph Collyer the Younger, he set up in business
                  as a line-engraver in 1779. He was soon commissioned to engrave
                  drawings and designs by a rising artist, Thomas Stothard (1755-1834),
                  and his work appeared in John Bell's <em>The Poets of Great
                  Britain</em> (1779-81) and Harrison's best-selling <em>Novelists'
                  Magazine</em> (1780-88). Amongst his earliest assignments were
                  also a set of portraits for the <em>Collected Works</em> of Horace
                  Walpole, although these were not published until 1798. With
                  his reputation firmly established through his collaboration
                  with Stothard, commissions flooded in for such publications
                  as the <em>Lady's Poetical Magazine</em>, Martyn's <em>Geography</em> (Heath's
                  first attempt at landscape-engraving), the <em>British Magazine
                  and Review</em>, <em>British Classicks</em>, and <em>Picturesque
                Views of the Principle Seats of Nobility and Gentry</em>. </td>

                    had amassed a considerable fortune, only to see most of his
                    property (and work in process) destroyed by a house fire.
                    He continued to work prolifically, producing prints for John
                    Bell's <em>The British Theatre</em> (1791-97) and John Boydell's <em> </em> (1791-1803),
                    a work credited with reviving an interest in historical painting.
                    Two separately issued larger prints by Heath also proved
                    successful, Francis Wheatley's <em>The Riot in Broad Street</em> after
                    Francis Wheatley (1790) and <em>The Death of Major Pierson </em>(1796)
                    after John Singleton Copley. The latter is regarded as Heath's
                masterpiece in the historical genre.</div></td>

            <p>In 1791 Heath was elected an Associate Engraver to the Royal Academy
              (one of only six posts reserved for engravers). Membership of this
              body permitted him regular contact with the leading artists of
              the day and led to further commissions. In 1794, he was appointed
              Historical Engraver to George III, a position he would hold under
              successive monarchs until his own death. He now felt emboldened
              to begin publishing prints and, later, illustrated books,
              on his own account, breaking away from the stranglehold imposed
              on the printing trade by dealers and publishers. If not the first
              engraver to follow this path, he was the first to do so with any
              lasting commercial success. In particular, his engraving of George
              Washington after Gilbert Stuart sold in unprecedented numbers
              on both sides of the Atlantic. Although set back by another house
              fire in 1797, he published his own edition of Shakespeare (1802)
              to rival Boydell's, preparing all the engravings himself after
              designs by Stothard and Henry Fuseli (1741-1825). Other projects
              included George Shaw's <em>General Zoology</em> (1800-26) and Dr
              Johnson's
            <em>Lives of the Poets</em> (1802-10). </p>
            <p>In 1801, Heath pioneered a further new
                field, producing in collaboration with the German patentee Philipp
                Andre the first lithographic prints to be published in Great
              Britain. Although this venture proved premature, Heath's later
              years also contained a number of commercial successes, notably
              plates of the <em>Death of Lord Nelson</em> (1811) after Benjamin
              West
and of <em>The Canterbury Pilgrims </em>(1817) after Stothard (a work left unfinished
at his death by Lewis Schiavonetti and completed by Heath). Latterly, though,
              much of  his professional life was dedicated to building up a family
              printing business and to grooming his talented son
              <a href="cheath.html">Charles Heath</a> to take over upon his retirement. He finally retired
from business in 1822, the year that saw the publication of his edition
              of Hogarth's Works, for which he            had re-engraved from
              the original worn copper-plates 116 of Hogarth's drawings. Heath
              died on November 15 1834. Such was Heath's prominence during his
lifetime that, unusually for an engraver, numerous portraits of him exist. To

                <td width="53%">Heath's Scott-related engravings are clearly
                  only a small part of his immense professional output. Nonetheless,
                  not only
                  did he produce the first engraving of a portrait of Scott (James
                  Saxon's <a href="../paintings/images/saxon.html">1805 painting</a>),
                  but he also engraved some of the earliest and most influential
                  illustrations to Scott's work. In 1808 he engraved John Christian
                  Schetky's <em>Illustrations of Walter Scott's Lay of the Last
                  Minstrel</em>, consisting of views of New Tower, Branksome
                  Hall, the Lands of Deloraine, the Peel of Goldieland, Hawick,
                  Melrose Abbey, the Eildon Hills, Dryhope Tower, St Mary's Loch,
                Wat of Harden's Den, Hermitage Castle, and Naworth Castle.</td>

              engraved one plate after Richard Westall (1765-1836) for John Sharpe's
              edition of <a href="../../works/poetry/marmion.html"><em>Marmion</em></a>,
              and a further plate after Westall for <a href="../../works/poetry/lord.html"><em>The
              Lord of the Isles</em></a> in
              1815. Finally, the last months of Heath's working life saw him
              engaged almost exclusively on Scott-related projects. From 1819-22,
              he produced 18 prints after Stothard, Westall, and Henry Corbould
              (1787-1844) for <em>The Lady's Magazine</em>,
              illustrating <em><a href="../../works/novels/dwarf.html">The Black Dwarf</a></em>, <a href="../../works/novels/midlothian.html"><em>The

              Heath Family Engravers 1779-1878</em> and a descendant of the artist, James Heath
              also made 14 prints after Stothard for an 1820 Rodwell and Martin
              edition of <em>Tales of My Landlord</em>. These may well, however, be identical
              with some of the <em>Lady's Magazine</em> material.</p>
