                <td width="67%">The painter, illustrator, engraver, and lithographer
                  George Baird Shaw was born on 23 March 1812 in Dumfries, Scotland.
                  His family moved to Edinburgh where his father James Shaw worked
                  as a senior clerk and proof-reader for the booksellers and
                  publishers Cadell &amp; Company, publishers of the Magnum Opus
                  edition of the Waverley Novels. James Shaw had trained as a
                  lithographer
                  and engraver in Glasgow and was a keen amateur painter. He
                  gave George (and his artist-brother James) a firm grounding
                  in these arts then sent him to the Academy of Fine Arts in
                  Trieste, Italy, to perfect his skills. After returning to Scotland,
                  Shaw engraved a number of portraits for <em>Chambers Biographical
                  Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen</em> (1835), including <em>James
                  Beattie</em> after Sir Joshua Reynolds, <em>Maj. Gen. David
                  Stewart</em> after Sir John Watson Gordon (see right), and <em>Sir
                  Henry Raeburn</em> after a self-portrait. Shortly afterwards
                  he was commissioned to engrave portraits of Sir Walter Scott
                  and his family for the 2nd edition of John Gibson Lockhart's<em> Memoirs
                  of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart. </em>See <a href="../../biography/origins.html">Family

            <p>The success of Shaw's engravings for Lockhart's <em>Memoirs</em> led
              to a second prestigious Scott-related commission: a series of full-size
              steel engravings
              for the influential Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels (1842-47).
              For vol. I (<em>Waverley</em> &amp; <em>Guy Mannering</em>), Shaw
              engraved portraits of Col. James Gardiner after
              his own design and Prince
              Charles Edward Stuart after Louis Tocqu&eacute;. For vol.
              II (<em>The Antiquary</em>, <em>The Black Dwarf </em>&amp; <em>Old
              Mortality</em>), he engraved John Graham of Claverhouse
              after Clarkson Stanfield. For vol. IV (<em>The Bride of Lammermoor</em>,
              <em>A Legend of Montrose</em> &amp; <em>Ivanhoe</em>), he engraved
              James Graham, Marquis of Montrose after a print in Edmund Lodge's
              <em>Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great Britain</em>.
              For vol. V (<em>The
              Monastery</em> &amp; <em>The Abbot</em>), he engraved the Regents
              Murray and Morton and Mary Queen of Scots (all after Lodge). For
              vol. VI (<em>Kenilworth</em> &amp; <em>The Pirate</em>), he engraved
              Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester after Lodge and Queen Elizabeth
              I after Federico Zuccaro. For vol. VII (<em>The Fortunes of Nigel</em> &amp; <em>Peveril
              of the Peak</em>), he engraved James VI and I, George
              Heriot (both after Paulus van Somer), Charles II (after Kneller),
              and George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham (after S. Austin). For
              volume VIII (<em>Quentin Durward</em> &amp; <em>St. Ronan&#8217;s
              Well</em>), he engraved Louis XI (after C. N. Th&eacute;venin),
              and, finally, for vol. X (<em>Woodstock</em> &amp; <em>Chronicles
              of the Canongate</em>),
              he engraved Cromwell after Lodge and John Greenshield's statue
              of Scott.</p>

            </table>            <p>Shaw also worked as an illustrator for the <em>Art Journal </em>for many
              years. Major non-Scott-related works include the individual plates
              <em>John Angel James (Independent Minister)</em> after H. Anelay,
              <em>Thomas Thomson</em> after Robert Scott Lauder, and <em>George
              Wishart</em>,
              now in the <a href="http://www.nationalgalleries.org/">Scottish
              National Portrait Gallery</a>.</p>
            <p>Shaw emigrated in 1850, arriving in January 1851 in Dunedin,
              New Zealand, where he remained for five years. He exhibited a view
              of that town
              in
              November
              which
              he proposed to make into a lithograph, a project which fell through
              due to lack of support. In 1856 he left New Zealand for Australia.
              He first visited his brother James, a prolific portrait painter
              and photographer who had been living in Adelaide since 1850. At
              the First Exhibition of the South Australian Society of Arts in
              1857,
              he
              showed <em>Othello
              and Iago</em> and <em>Edinburgh
              from the Calton Hill</em> as an Adelaide
              resident. He then settled in Sidney where over the next decade
              he produced a series of portraits, some drawn, some engraved, of
              Sydney politicians and clergy. He returned to Adelaide in 1866 and
              exhibited several proof copies of his engravings including one
              of <em>The Silver
                    Cord Loosed</em> after
                    Sir Joseph Noel Paton. At the 1867 Exhibition of the South
                    Australian Society of Arts he was awarded the five-guinea
                    prize for the best South
              Australian oil landscape painting. After visiting New Zealand in
                    1867, he returned to Sydney where he remained throughout
                    the 1870s. He showed three landscapes <em>Harbour
              View, from Double Bay</em>, <em>On the Manning River </em>and<em> Macleay
                      Heads, and Trial Bay</em>  at
                      the 1870
                      Sydney Intercolonial Exhibition. His last recorded works
                      were displayed at the 1877 exhibition of the New
                      South
                      Wales Academy of Art: a watercolour <em>The Bass
                      Rock</em>, a crayon portrait of A.
                      Roberts
                      MD, and
              an oil painting <em>The Pets</em>. He died in Sydney in 1883.</p>

               his descendants in Australia, established that the Edinburgh-based

              George Baird Shaw. Of the above sources, only the <em>Dictionary
