            <h2> <font color="#003366">Schenck &amp; MacFarlane </font></h2>
            <p>Friedrich Schenck (sometimes spelt Schenk) was born in Offenbach,
              Germany, in 1811. He trained as an artist and lithographer in Munich
              and
              Paris, and was brought to Edinburgh in 1840 by the lithographer
              and printseller Samuel Leith. In 1842 Schenck married Jane, daughter
              of the Orcadian poet David Vedder, and established his own lithographic
              business. He presented several papers on developments in lithography
              to the Royal Scottish Society for the Arts and was later awarded
              its Gold Medal for his contribution to Scottish lithography. In
              1848 he entered into an informal partnership with the Belgian artist
              Louis Gh&eacute;mar, then in 1850 set up the firm of
              Schenck &amp; MacFarlane with William Husband MacFarlane (b. Dunfermline,
              1805). Schenck &amp; MacFarlane established a substantial reputation
              for the quality and variety of work that they produced, so much
              so that Schenck was invited to write the article on 'Lithography'
              for the 8th edition of the <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>. In
              1859 the partnership was dissolved, but MacFarlane continued to
              operate
              under the banner of Schenck &amp; MacFarlane until 1871 when failing
              health forced him into partnership with William Erskine.
              He died in Italy in 1875. Following the dissolution of his partnership
              with MacFarlane,  Schenck specialized in
              artistic work, especially chalk portraiture
              in collaboration with Otto Leyde. From 1866 to 1868 he worked in
              partnership with is son Frederick until the latter decided to pursue
              the study of sculpture. Schenck retired in 1875 and devoted his
              last years to teaching French and German and to writing historical
              and descriptive works on Germany. He died in Edinburgh in 1885. </p>
