            <h2> <font color="#003366">Henry Bryan Hall (1808-84)</font></h2>
            <p>The stipple engraver and portrait painter Henry Bryan Hall, was
              born in London on 11 May 1808 and served his apprenticeship under
              the engravers Benjamin Smith and <a href="meyer.html">Henry Meyer</a>.
              He was subsequently employed by Henry Thomas Ryall who held the
              title of 'Portrait and Historical Engraver to Her Majesty, Queen
              Victoria'. In this capacity, Hall contributed plates to Ryall's
              <em>Eminent Conservative Statesmen</em> (1837-38) and helped to
              engrave the seventy portraits in Ryall's plate of <em>The Coronation
              of Queen Victoria</em> after George
              Hayter (1838-42). Further bookwork included engravings of English
              Protestant martyrs for C. Birch (1839) and contributions to John
              Wilson and Robert Chambers's <em>The Land of Burn</em>s (1840), <em>Finden's
              Gallery
              of Beauty</em> (1841), J. W. Carleton's Sporting <em>Sketch-Book</em> (1842),
              and J. Kitto's <em>Gallery of Scripture Engravings</em> (1846-49). </p>
            <p>Hall
                emigrated to New York in 1850, set up the firm of H. B. Hall
              and Sons, and
                established
                an
                extensive
                practice
                as
                engraver
                and
                publisher of portraits. In particular, he etched a large number
                of portraits of prominent figures in American colonial and revolutionary
                history
                for a private club in New York and for Philadelphia collectors.
                Hall was also a talented portrait painter in his own right specialising
                in miniature work on ivory. While still in London, he had painted
                Napoleon III, and, following his move to America, produced acclaimed
                portraits of fellow artists Thomas Sully and C. L. Elliott. Hall's
                children Alfred, Alice, Charles, and Henry were all talented
              engravers. In particular, Henry Bryan Hall the Younger (fl. 1855-1900)
              is
                celebrated for his engravings of the leading figures in the US
                Civil War (in which
                he fought). As both father and son engraved portraits of US military
                and political heroes, it is sometimes difficult to establish
              which is responsible for a particular plate. Hall died in Morrisania,
                New York, on 25 April 1884.</p>            
            <p>Henry Bryan Hall's only Scott-related work appears to be an engraving
              of the <a href="../paintings/images/gordonhall.html">1830 portrait</a> by <a href="../artists/gordon.html">Sir
              John Watson Gordon</a>, published as the
              frontispiece to Charles Daly's 1837 edition of <em><a href="../../works/poetry/minstrel.html">The
              Lay of the Last Minstrel</a></em>. Click on the image below to
