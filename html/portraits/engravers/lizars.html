            <h2> <font color="#003366">William Home Lizars (1788-1859)</font></h2>
            <p>Born in Edinburgh in 1788, William Home Lizars was the
              son of Daniel Lizars, a well known copperplate engraver and printer.
              Lizars was first apprenticed to his father then, from 1802 to 1805,
              studied under John Graham at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh,
              an institution
		  established in 1760 to teach drawing and design for use
			  in manufacture. Lizars sought to establish himself as a painter,
              frequently exhibiting both portraits and genre paintings between
              1805 and 1815. In 1812, he sent two pictures, 'Reading the Will'
              and 'A Scotch Wedding' to the Royal Academy in London, which met
              with great success. They were engraved by Charles Turner and may
              well have influenced the identically titled works by <a href="../artists/wilkie.html">Sir
              David Wilkie</a> (a contemporary of Lizars at the Trustees' Academy). In
              the same year, however, the death of Lizars's father forced him
              to abandon painting. In order to support his mother and family,
              he was compelled to take over the family printing and engraving
              business.</p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="61%">Lizars, who had extensive experience already
                  co-producing book-plates with his father, first made an independent
                  reputation
                  by producing notes for local banks. In 1818, he was employed,
                  together with <a href="../painters/geddes.html">Andrew Geddes</a>,
                  William Allan, and the Revd. John Thompson, to make a pictorial
                  record of the Regalia of Scotland following their rediscovery
                  by a Royal Commission headed by Scott (see the page on Andrew
                  Geddes's <a href="../paintings/regalia.html">Discovery of the
                  Regalia of Scotland</a>). He went on to work prolifically for
                  the book trade. An early success was J.G. Lockhart's <em>Peter's
                  Letters to His Kinsfolk </em>(1819), a satirical guide to the
                  Edinburgh literary world for which Lizars engraved the portraits
                  including a derivation of Raeburn's <a href="../paintings/images/raeburnlizars.html">1808
                  portrait</a> of Scott (click on thumbnail right). His work
                  covering a wide variety of genres: landscapes for such publications
                  as <em>Views

                  N.G. Phillips (1822-24) and Feldborg's <em>Denmark Delineated </em>(1824);
                  anatomical plates for his brother John Lizars, and natural
                history for J.J. Audubon's <em>The Birds of America</em>, 1827-30. </td>

            <p>He contributed extensively to the growing number
                            of publications catering for the Scottish tourist
              trade (that had received such an impetus from the success
                            of
                            Scott's novels), notably <em>Picturesque Views of
                            Edinburgh</em>, <em>The
                            Scottish Tourist</em>, and Robert Chambers's <em>The
                            Picture of Scotland</em>. For the latter, he engraved
                            Loch Katrine (made famous by <a href="../../works/poetry/lake.html"><em>The
                            Lady of the Lake</em>)</a>,
                            Melrose Abbey (made famous by <a href="../../works/poetry/minstrel.html"><em>The
                            Lay of the Last Minstrel</em></a>), Fast Castle (often
                            seen as the model for Wolf's Crag in <a href="../../works/novels/bride.html"><em>The Bride
                            of Lammermoor</em></a>), and one of the earliest images of Scott's <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> home.
                            He published a further image of Abbotsford, after
                            his own design, in 1832.</p>            <table width="100%">

                          constantly experimented with new techniques and, in
              1821, perfected
                          a method
                          of etching

                          of the Royal Scottish Academy and in 1834 was elected
                          an Honorary
                          member. He died 30 March 1859 in Jedburgh.</p>
