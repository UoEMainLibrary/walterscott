            <h2> <font color="#003366">William Dickes (1815-92)</font></h2>
            <p>The wood engraver and pioneering colour printer William Dickes
              was born in Beechencliff, near Bath, on 7 May 1815. He was apprenticed
              to the wood engraver Robert Branston Junior around 1831, then from
              1835 attended the Royal Academy Schools where he won several
              medals for drawing. His first large-scale commission was to illlustrate
              <em>The Naturalist's Library</em> for <a href="lizars.html">W.H.
              Lizars</a> in
              1840. Shortly afterwards, he drew illustrations on wood for Charles
              Knight's <em>London</em> (1841)
              and Captain Maryatt's <em>Masterman Ready</em> (1842). In 1842
              he was commissioned by Robert Cadell to draw illustrations and
              to supervise engraving (mostly on wood) for the Abbotsford Edition
              of the Waverley Novels. It was this publication which firmly established
              Dickes as a wood engraver. Not only did he win a solid reputation
              for the intricacy of his work, but he also made many useful contacts
              among the many leading illustrators who contributed to the project.
              In 1846, he was able to set himself up in business on his own in
              London as a 'artist and engraver in wood and copper'. He now began
              to work as a lithographer and to experiment with colour printing
              in oil from wood blocks. Popular publications to which he
              contributed include Simm's &amp; McIntyre's <em>Parlour Library</em> (1847-62),
              Amalie Winter's
              <em>Michael and the Twins</em> (1850), H. Noel Humphreys's <em>The
              Poet's Pleasance</em>              (1847) and <em>Sentiments and
              Similes of William Shakespeare</em> (1851),
              and Charles Kingsley's <em>Glaucus</em> (1855).</p>

            <p>Dickes is also known for his pioneering work in developping colour
              printing techniques. He displayed specimens of oil colour printing
              from raised
              surfaces
              at the Great
              Exhibition in 1851 and exhibited in Paris in 1855. In 1864 he
              began collaborating with his sons Walter and William Frederick
              as William Dickes and Company. Their premises at 109 Faringdon
              Road,
              London,
              covered five storeys of printing and engraving works where Dickes
              trained five artists and two engravers. The firm won prizes at
              the International Exhibitions
              in
              London
              (1862),
              Dublin
              (1865),
              and
              Paris (1867). They became the principal colour printers for the
              Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, the <em>People's Magazine</em>,
              <em>Gentleman's Journal</em>, <em>Queen</em>, and the <em>Religious
              Tract Society</em>, catering
              extensively for the Victorian middle-class and lower middle-class
              readership. Wilkes retired in 1873, by which time trade was slackening,
              and
              died on 26 February 1892.</p>
