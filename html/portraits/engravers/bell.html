            <h2> <font color="#003366">Robert Charles Bell (1806-72)</font></h2>
            <p>The landscape, historical, and portrait engraver Robert Charles
              Bell was born in Edinburgh on 5 September 1806. He was apprenticed
              to the painter and engraver John Beugo and attended classes at
              the Trustees' Academy School of Art under Sir William Allan. His
              first major commission was for a series of Scottish views published
              in the 1830s by Joseph Swan of Glasgow. In the following decade
              he produced plates for the Royal Association for Promotion of the
              Fine Arts in Scotland, the Art Union of Scotland, and the National
              Art-Union for Ireland. Between 1850 and 1874, Bell published ten
              plates in the <em>Art Journal</em> after some of the most important
              historical and genre artists of the day, including <a href="../artists/wilkie.html">Sir
              David Wilkie</a>, Charles Robert Leslie, William Mulready, and
              John and Thomas Faed. He devoted many years of work to his largest
              and most significant plate,<em> The Battle of Prestonpans</em> after
              Sir William Allan, which was only completed shortly before his
              death in 1872.</p>
            <p>Bell's commissions for the Royal Association for Promotion of
              the Fine Arts in Scotland included a number of illustrations to
              the works of Scott. Between 1865 and 1882 the Association brought
              out annual volumes for its own members, each devoted to a particular
              work by Scott and featuring six to eight engravings of scenes by
              leading historical genre artists. For the volume dedicated to <em><a href="../../works/novels/waverley.html">Waverley</a> </em>(1865),
              Bell engraved <em>The Hold of a Highland Robber</em> after J. B.
              Macdonald and <em>Bailie Macwheeble at Breakfast</em> after James
              Eckford Lauder. For <em><a href="../../works/novels/mannering.html">Guy
              Mannering</a></em> (1866), he engraved <em>The Capture of Dirk
              Hatteraick</em> after Macdonald. For <em><a href="../../works/novels/antiquary.html">The
              Antiquary</a></em> (1867), he engraved <em>The Antiquary and Lovel
              Entering the Sanctum </em>after Robert Herdman. For <em><a href="../../works/novels/robroy.html">Rob
              Roy</a></em> (1868), he engraved <em>Diana Vernon and Frank Osbaldistone
              in the Library: The Glove Scene</em> after Herdman. For <em><a href="../../works/novels/mortality.html">Old
              Mortality</a></em> (1869), he engraved <em>Morton Awaiting his
              Death at the Hands of the Cameronians in the Farm-house of Drumshinnel
              after William Dougas</em>. Finally, for <em><a href="../../works/novels/pirate.html">The
              Pirate</a> </em>(1871), he engraved <a href="../paintings/images/castlest.html"><em>Sir
              Walter Scott in his Study at Castle Street</em></a> after <a href="../artists/gordon.html">Sir
              John Watson Gordon</a>. He had earlier contributed an engraving
              to another of the Association's annual publications, J. Noel Paton's
              illustrated edition (1860) of the traditional ballad 'The Dowie
              Dens of Yarrow' anthologized by Scott in <em><a href="../../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html">Minstrelsy
              of the Scottish Border</a></em>.</p>
