              <p align="center">Sarah Siddons (n&eacute;e Kemble) was considered
                the finest tragedian and interpreter of Shakespeare of her age.
                Offstage, Scott found her 'a vain foolish woman spoild [sic]
                (and no wonder) by unbounded adulation to a degree that deserved
                praise tasted faint on her palate'. He doubted, however, that
                he would ever see another actress who came 'within a hundred
                degrees of what she was in her zenith' (letter to Joanna Baillie,
                17 April 1819). He appealed to Mrs Siddons for support of the
                new patent for the Edinburgh Theatre that would put its management
                under the control of the Duke of Buccleuch, Walter Scott himself,
                and Henry Mackenzie, among others. Her son Henry Siddons was
                subsequently appointed manager. The original portrait by Sir
                Joshua Reynolds was painted in 1784. The engraving by William
                Holl the Younger was first published in Knight's <em>Portrait
              Gallery</em>              (1835).</p>
