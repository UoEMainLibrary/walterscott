              <p align="center">From: <em>The Authors of England: A Series of Medallion
                Portraits of Modern Literary Characters, <br>
                Engraved from the Works
              of British Artists</em> (London: Charles Tilt, 1838)</p>
              <p align="center">Sir Walter Scott was a friend
                and admirer of William Wordworth. They first met when Scott accompanied
                the poet and his sister on a tour of the Border Country in September
                1803. Scott visited the Wordsworths at Grasmere in August 1805
                and climbed Helvellyn with Wordsworth and Sir Humphry Davey.
                A further visit to Grasmere took place in August 1825. Finally,
                the Wordsworths visited <a href="../../../biography/homes.html#abbotsford">Abbotsford</a> in
                1831, leading Wordsworth to compose 'On the Departure of Sir
                Walter Scott from Abbotsford,
                for Naples'. Writing of Wordsworth, Scott declared that he did
                not know 'a man more to be venerated for uprightness of heart
                and loftiness of genius' (letter to Allan Cunningham, 7 January
                1821). His conversation 'as much distinguished by manly sense
                and candour as by talent and principle, was like a fountain in
                the desert' (letter to Sir George Beaumont, 28 August 1825).
                Scott, who particularly admired Wordsworth's sonnets, regretted
                that his poetry was not as popular as it deserved to be as it
                was 'too subtle and metaphysical in the idea, &amp; too blunt
                in the expression' (letter to Allan Cunningham, 14 October 1828).
                The medallion by Weekes was cast after a bust by <a href="../artists/chantrey.html">Sir
                Francis Leggatt Chantrey</a>.</p>
