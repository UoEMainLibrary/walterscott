              <p align="center">This portrait of Isabelle de Croye, heroine of
                Sir Walter Scott's <a href="../../../works/novels/durward.html"><em>Quentin
                Durward</em></a> (1823), is inspired by the
                eponymous hero's first glimpse of her: 'He speedily made the
                discovery that a quantity of long black tresses, which, in the
                maiden fashion of his own country, were unadorned by any ornament,
                except a single chaplet lightly woven out of ivy leaves, formed
                a veil around a countenance which, in its regular features, dark
                eyes, and pensive expression, resembled that of Melpomene, though
                there was a faint glow on the cheek, and an intelligence on the
                lips and in the eye, which made it seem that gaiety was not foreign
                to a countenance so expressive, although it might not be its
              most habitual expression.' (Ch. 4) Although not published in volume
                form until 1834, the plate bears the imprint '1832'.</p>
