              George Baird Shaw</a> after an unknown artist (1844)</h3>
              <p align="center">From: Sir Walter Scott, <em>The Abbot</em> (Edinburgh:
                Adam and Charles Black, 1877)</p>
              <p align="center">James Douglas, Earl of Morton (d. 1581) was a
                principal actor in the murder of Mary Stuart's secretary
                David Rizzio
                and was later
                involved in the plot against Lord Darnley. He was chief advisor
                to the Regent Murray, becoming Regent after his death, and defeated
                Mary's forces at Langside after her escape from Lochleven Castle.
                In Scott's <a href="../../../works/novels/abbot.html"><em>The
                Abbot</em></a> he is portrayed as 'deep and dark' (ch.
                3), the implacable and ruthless enemy of Mary and the Catholic
                cause.
                His military and political career are also described in Scott's
              <a href="../../../works/prose/grandfather.html">                    <em>Tales
              of a Grandfather, First Series</em></a> (1828). This engraving
              was first published in vol. V of the Abbotsford Edition of the
              Waverley Novels (Edinburgh: Cadell, 1844). It is based on an earlier
              engraving in Lodge's <em>Portraits of Illustrious Personages of
              Great Britain</em>.</p>
