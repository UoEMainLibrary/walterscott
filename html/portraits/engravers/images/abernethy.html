              <p align="center">The Round Tower of Abernethy (near Perth) was
                built in the ninth century and is one of only two such towers
                in Scotland.
                Over 70 feet tall, it was built by monks from the nearby
                monastery and has served  as a place
                of refuge, a belfry, and a burial chamber. In 1072 Scottish king
                Malcolm Canmore was forced to kneel at the Tower and pay homage
                to William the Conqueror. This engraving
                was originally published in the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley
                Novels (1846).<br>
