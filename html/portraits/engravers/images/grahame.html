                engraved by <a href="../freeman.html">Samuel Freeman</a>              after
                an unknown artist (1835?)</h3>
              <p align="center">From: James Grant Wilson, <em>The Poets
                and Poetry of Scotland </em>(London: Blackie &amp; Son, 1876-77)</p>
              <p align="center">Sir Walter Scott was a great admirer of the Rev.
                James Grahame&#8217;s <em>The Sabbath</em> (1804), 'a very pretty
                poem' which he recommended to James Currie and Anna Seward in
                letters
                of
                25 February and 21 March 1805. John Ballantyne and Co., in which
                Scott held a half-share, published Grahame's <em>British Georgics</em> (1809).
                Grahame (1765-1811) was a fellow Advocate who abandoned the Bar
                to take orders as an Anglican clergyman. Scott sought unsuccessfully
                to use
                his influence to have Grahame elected to the Lectureship of St
                George&#8217;s Chapel, Edinburgh, in October 1808. On his death
                in 1811, Scott lamented him as 'one good man lost to the best
                of possible worlds' who 'had conscience and modesty enough for
                a whole General Assembly or Convocation' (letter to Charles Kirkpatrick
                Sharpe, 4 December 1811). He regretted however that his 'principles
                and prejudices and feelings made an odd jumble', hampering both
                his legal and ecclesiastical careers. He was a Jacobite yet a
                Whig, an Anglican yet an apologist for the Covenanters. Scott
                recalled teasing him for his detestation of his own kinsman John
                Graham of Claverhouse, scourge of the Covenanters (portrayed
                by Scott in <a href="../../../works/novels/mortality.html"><em>Old
                Mortality</em></a>). Grahame is also mentioned in <a href="../../../works/prose/witchcraft.html"><em>Letters
                on Demonology and Witchcraft</em></a> as sharing the family superstition
                that the colour green is fatal to the Grahame clan, and having
              his library table covered instead in blue or black cloth. The engraving
                was made from 'a miniature in possession of Robert Grahame of
                Whitehill'. It was probably first published in Robert Chambers's <em>Biographical
                Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen</em> (1835).</p>
