              George Baird Shaw</a> after an unknown artist (1844)</h3>
              <p align="center">From: Sir Walter Scott, <em>The Abbot</em> (Edinburgh:
                Adam and Charles Black, 1877)</p>
              <p align="center">Scott's <a href="../../../works/novels/abbot.html"><em>The
                  Abbot</em></a> (1820)
                revolves around the imprisonment and escape from Loch Leven Castle,
                Fife, of Mary, Queen of Scots. Scott also treats her reign at
                length in his historical works <a href="../../../works/prose/grandfather.html"><em>Tales
                of a Grandfather, First Series</em></a> (1828) and <em>The History
                of Scotland</em> (1830). The engraving by
                George B. Shaw is based on an earlier engraving by <a href="../thomson.html">James
                Thomson</a>                which appeared in Edmund Lodge's <em>Portraits of Illustrious
                Personages of Great Britain</em>. The original painting by an unknown
              artist is known as the Morton or Dalmahoy Portrait.</p>
