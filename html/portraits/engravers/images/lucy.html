              <p align="center">This plate depicting Lucy Ashton, heroine of
                Sir Walter Scott's <a href="../../../works/novels/lammermoor.html"><em>The
                Bride of Lammermoor</em></a> (1819),
                is inspired by the following description: 'Lucy Ashton's exquisitely
                beautiful, yet somewhat girlish features were formed to express
                peace of mind, serenity, and indifference to the tinsel of wordly
                pleasure. Her locks, which were of shadowy gold, divided on a
                brow of exquisite whiteness, like a gleam of broken and pallid
                sunshine upon a hill of snow. The expression of the countenance
                was in the last degree gentle, soft, timid, and feminine, and
                seemed rather to shrink from the most casual look of a stranger
                than to court his admiration. Something there was of a Madonna
                cast, perhaps the result of delicate health, and of residence
                in a family where the dispositions of the inmates were fiercer,
                more active, and energetic than her own.' (<em>The Bride of Lammermoor</em>,
                ch. 3) Although not published in volume form until 1834, the
                plate bears
                the
                imprint
                '1833'.</p>
