              <p align="center">From: Robert Chambers (ed.), <em>A Biographical
                Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen</em> (Glasgow: Blackie, 1835)</p>
              <p align="center">The political economist and linguist John Bowring
                visited Scott at <a href="../../../biography/homes.html#abbotsford">Abbotsford</a> in 1830. Scott thought him a 'clever'
                and 'very agreeable' man (letter to Robert Cadell, 23 April 1830).
                A description of the visit and a biographical sketch of Scott
                are included in the posthumously printed <em>Autobiographical
                Recollections of Sir John Bowring</em> (London: Henry S. King, 1877). During the
                last months of his life Bowring was part of the Committee which
                organized the celebration of the centenary of Scott's birth in
                Melrose in 1871. The engraving by Willam Holl the Younger was
                first published in 1840; the original portrait was probably completed
              shortly beforehand.</p>
