              <p align="center">From: <em>The Authors of England: A Series of Medallion
                Portraits of Modern Literary Characters, <br>
                Engraved from the Works
              of British Artists</em> (London: Charles Tilt, 1838)</p>
              <p align="center">Sir Walter Scott first met Robert Southey
                when the poet visited him at <a href="../../../biography/homes.html">Ashestiel</a> in
                August 1805. Later in the
                same month, Scott visited Southey at Keswick, and subsequently
                made futher visits in 1813 and 1825. Southey contributed to a
                number of Scott's literary projects, including <em>An Apology
                for Tales of Terror</em> (1799), his <em>English Minstrelsy</em> (1810),
                the <em>Quarterly
                Review</em>, and the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em>. Scott
                made repeated attempts to secure a salary for the impecunious
                Southey, culminating in 1813 when Scott was offered the position
                of Poet Laureate but declined in favour of
                his friend. </p>
