                <td width="62%">Abraham Raimbach was born in London to a Swiss
                  father and English mother on 16 February 1776. He was educated
                  at Archbishop Tenison's School, then, in 1789, articled to
                  the engraver John Hall. Following his apprenticeship, he studied
                  at the Royal Academy for nine years, gaining a silver medal
                  for life-drawing in 1799. He supported himself while studying
                  by engraving small plates for Cooke's editions of the British
                  poets and novelists. In 1801 he engraved three plates, from
                  designs by Robert Smirke for the Rev. E. Forster's edition
                  of the <em>Arabian Nights</em>, the earnings from which permitted
                  him to visit Paris the following year (benefiting from the
                  Peace of Amiens) and to study the artworks gathered there by
                  Napoleon. On his return he collaborated again with Smirke on
                  illustrations for an edition of Johnson's <em>Rasselas</em> (1805)
                  and began to work extensively with Sharpe, Longman, and other
                  publishers.</td>

              1812, <a href="../artists/wilkie.html">Sir David Wilkie</a> proposed to Raimbach that they collaborate
              on a series of large plates to be engraved after paintings by Wilkie.
              It is on these enormously popular and critically acclaimed works
              that Raimbach's reputation primarily rests. Their first joint work
              was a print of <em>The Village Politicians</em> (1814), a proof
              of which was exhibited at the Paris Salon and awarded a gold medal.
              It was followed by <em>The Rent Day</em> (1817, click on thumbnail,
              right), <em>The Cut Finger</em> (1819), <em>Blind Man's Buff</em> (1822), <em>The
              Errand Boy</em> (1825), <em>Distraining for Rent</em> (1828), <em>The
              Parish Beadle</em> (1834), and <em>The Spanish Mother</em> (1836).
              The collaboration with Wilkie brought Raimbach financial security.
              Wilkie was godfather to one of Raimbach's sons, named David Wilkie
              Raimbach in his honour, who became a portrait artist and, subsequently,
              headmaster of the Birmingham School of Art. Raimbach visited Paris
              again in 1824 and 1825, earning the admiration of some of France's
              leading engravers. In 1835 he was elected a corresponding member
              of the Institut de France. He died in Greenwich on 17 January 1843.</p>

                <td width="57%"><p>Raimbach only appears to have produced two
                    Scott-related engravings. In 1811, he engraved the <a href="../paintings/images/raeburnraimbach.html">1808
                    portrait</a> of Scott by <a href="../artists/raeburn.html">Sir
                    Henry Raeburn</a>. A mezzotint print
                    had previously been produced by Charles Turner, but Scott
                    judged
                    it 'far
                    inferior'
                    to
                    Raimbach's
                    version. Scott sent copies of the Raimbach print to friends
                    including John Leyden and Lady Abercorn, to whom he described
                    it as 'prettily engraved' (<em>Letters</em>, II, 450). Then,
                    in 1812, Raimbach engraved a plate after Richard Westall
                    for
                    Sharpe's edition of Scott's <em>Glenfinlas, and Other Ballads</em>,
