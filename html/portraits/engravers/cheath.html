                <td height="408">The landscape and figure engraver Charles Heath
                  was one of the most active and influential figures in British
                  book production
                  over the first half of the nineteenth-century. The son of <a href="jheath.html">James
                  Heath</a>, Engraver to the King, he was born on 1 March 1785.
                  Apprenticed to his father, he made such rapid progress that
                  in 1801, Benjamin West, President of the Royal Academy, commissioned
                  him to engrave his large painting <em>Our Lord Healing the
                  Sick</em>. Heath's true talent, however, lay for smaller plates
                  for book illustration, where he was deemed to have perfected
                  the style initiated by his father. He was soon so much in demand
                  that he formed an atelier of assistants and pupils. As work
                  produced by the atelier was invariably signed by Heath, it
                  is often difficult to distinguish his own contribution from
                  that of his co-workers. At first Heath and his atelier specialised
                  in topographical prints but they soon turned to figure work,
                  contributing prolifically to popular editions of English classics.
                  A restless innovator, Heath has been credited with producing,
                  for Thomas Campbell's <em>Pleasures of Hope</em> (1820), the
                  first British published plates to feature engraving on steel
                  rather than copper. Heath was certainly among the first to
                  grasp the commercial advantage of steel over copper plates.
                  Whereas the latter could produce only a few thousand prints,
                the latter could produce tens or even hundreds of thousands. </td>

              <tr>
                <td width="60%">Charles Heath was also employed as art editor
                  and chief contributor on the increasingly popular annuals such
                  as the <em>Forget Me Not</em>, <em>Literary Souvenir</em>,
                  and <em>The Amulet</em>. He came to feel that
                  the market for such productions was largely untapped and that
                  it might permit him the opportunity to work as his own proprietor,
                  introducing ambitious illustrative ventures, dealing with publishers
                  on his own terms, holding copyrights, and using his own printing
                  house. In 1827, he set up his own annual <em>The Keepsake</em>,
                  for which he sought to enlist the leading literary figures
                  of the day. Knowing Scott's financial plight (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html">Financial
                  Hardship</a>), he invited him to edit the annual. Scott thought
                  the plates 'beyond comparaison [sic] beautiful' but, as his <em>Journal</em> records
                  (30 January 1828), declined. He nonetheless sold Heath three
                  stories originally designed for <em><a href="../../works/novels/canongate.html">Chronicles
                  of the Canongate</a></em> but rejected by his publisher. 'My
                  Aunt Margaret's Mirror', 'The Tapestried Chamber', and 'Death
                  of the Laird's Jock' appeared in <em>The Keepsake for MDCCCXXIX</em>.
                  Scott's juvenile drama <em>The House of Aspen</em> followed
                  in <em>The Keepsake for MDCCCXXX</em> and, finally, 'A Highland
                  Anecdote' appeared in <em>The Keepsake for MDCCCXXXII</em>.
                  The <em>Keepsake</em> was followed, in 1832, by <em>Heath's
                  Picturesque Annual</em> and, in 1833, by<em> Heath's Book of
                  Beauty</em>. Heath was equally active in producing and promoting
                  large-scale pictorial monographs such as Turner's <em>Picturesque
                  Views in England and Wales</em>. </td>

            <p>From 1828 onwards, Heath engraved relatively little himself, increasingly
              delegating work to his two sons Frederick Augustus (1810-78) and
              Alfred (1812-1896). A third son, Henry became Miniature Painter
              to Queen Victoria while his daughter Fanny married the artist Edward
              Henry Corbould (a second-cousin) whose designs would be extensively
              engraved by the Heaths. The family business branched out into security
              engraving for banknotes, and in 1840, Charles and Frederick Augustus
              were responsible for the engraving of the world's first postage
              stamp, the 'Penny Black'. Despite his entrepreneurial talents,
              Heath suffered constant financial difficulties. Bankrupted in 1821,
              he was forced to sell stock engravings to raise money in 1826 and
              1840 and drawings by modern artists in 1839. Nonetheless, he continued
              to produce fine illustrated books such as <em>Heath's Beauties
              of the Opera and Ballet </em>until his sudden death on 18 November
              1848. His obituary in the Art Union declared 'that he has probably
              created as much work for his professional brethren as any living
              man'. </p>
            <p>Charles Heath was constantly occupied on Scott-related projects
              throughout his lengthy professional career. As his engravings were
              frequently republished, it is difficult to ascertain the first
              date of publication for each and to calculate precisely how many
              Scott illustrations he engraved. Besides the difficulty in ascertaining
              how much Heath contributed to the productions of his atelier, it
              is also sometimes difficult to establish whether an engraving signed
              'Heath' is the work of Charles or of his father. The following
              list of illustrations is by necessity, then, selective.</p>

              <tr>
                <td width="49%">As early as 1809 Heath engraved six designs by
                  Richard Westall for John Sharpe's illustrated edition of <a href="../../works/poetry/minstrel.html"><em>The
                  Lay of the Last Minstrel</em></a> and a further design by Westall
                  for Sharpe's edition of <em><a href="../../works/poetry/marmion.html">Marmion</a> </em>(to
                  which Heath's father James also contributed). In 1810 he again
                  engraved a design by Westall for Sharpe's <a href="../../works/poetry/lady.html"><em>The
                  Lady of the Lake</em></a> followed by designs for Westall and
                  Singleton for Constable's 6th edition of <em>Marmion</em>.
                  In 1812, he engraved a design by Thomas Stothard (with whom
                  his father had already frequently collaborated) for White &amp; Co's
                  edition of the <em><a href="../../works/poetry/donroderick.html">Vision
                  of Don Roderick</a></em> and, the following year, three designs

                  In 1815 he engraved four designs by Westall for Longman's edition

                <td width="62%" height="382">It is the early 1820s, however,
                  which sees Heath's greatest engagement with Scott's work. From
                  1820 to 1825 he
                  engraved numerous plates for Hurst, Robinson's series of <em>Illustrations
                  to the Works of the Author of Waverley. </em>From 1820 to 1826
                  he engraved nine Scott illustrations for <em>The Lady's Magazine</em>.
                  In addition, in 1820, he engraved Sir Henry Raeburn's <a href="../paintings/images/raeburnheath.html">1808
                  portrait</a> for Constable's edition of <em>The Poetical Works
                  of Walter Scott Esq.</em> and one plate for <em>Illustrations
                  of the Novels and Tales of the Author of Waverley from Designs
                  by William Allan</em>. The following year, he engraved a design
                  by Richard Cook for Longman's edition of <em>The Lady of the
                  Lake</em>. In 1823 he engraved all the title vignettes and
                  five frontispieces after designs by Charles Robert Leslie for
                  Constable's 18th edition of <em>The Novels and Tales of the
                  Author of Waverley</em>. In 1823, he engraved all the title-page
                  vignettes and five frontispieces for Constable's 4th edition
                  of <em>The Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott. </em>(He was
                  also to provide fresh vignettes for the 5th edition in 1830).
                  It was partly the reputation won by his exceptionally popular
                  engravings of Scott's works that persuaded Heath to set up
                  as his own proprietor.</td>

            <p align="left">These illustrations were much reprinted and it is not until the
              late 1820s that we find further Scott-related engravings. For the
              first two issues of his <em>Keepsake</em>, Heath engraved illustrations
              to <em><a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html">Ivanhoe</a></em> and
              'Death of the Laird's Jock'. In 1835, he engraved four illustrations
              to Scott's poetical works after George Cattermole for <em>Heath's
              Picturesque Annual</em>. <em>The

                (after J.M. Wright) illustrating <a href="../../works/novels/robroy.html"><em>Rob
                Roy</em></a>. Finally in 1840, he 'superintended' the engraving
                of the illustrations for <em>Heath's Waverley Gallery of the
                Principal Female Characters in Sir Walter Scott's Romances</em>,

              may seem surprising that Heath contributed only one engraving to
              the Magnum Opus edition of The Waverley Novels (the frontispiece
              to vol. I of <em>The Abbot</em>, right), especially considering
              that he was listed prominently among the engravers engaged when
              the Prospectus for the edition was published. However, Heath requested
              that 'instead of money you pay me for any Plates I may Engrave
              by writing as many pages per Plate [for the <em>Keepsake</em>]
              as may be agreed on' (letter of 23 February 1829, National Library
              of Scotland MS 3908/98-99). Scott judged this 'a pretty mode of
              accounting' and, with the approval of his editor Cadell, declined
              the proposal. Scott had also been struck by 'one funny part' of
              Heath's letter in which he assured Scott that, all the works having
              been previously published, 'the success of the new Edition of the
              waverley novels [sic] depended entirely on the excellence of the
              illustrations' (<em>Journal</em>, 27 February 1829). Scott appears
              to have been more amused than offended by Heath's comment, judging
              him 'well enough for his profession' (<em>Letters</em>, X, 374).
              Heath, though, appears to have lost the opportunity to contribute
              substantially to a landmark in the history of illustrated books.</p>            
            <p>For more engravings by Heath, search the <a href="../../imdata.html">Image
                Database</a>. Heath is the best-represented engraver in the <a href="../../corson.html">Corson
                Collection</a> and was probably the most prolific engraver of
                illustrations to Scott's work. For further information on Heath
