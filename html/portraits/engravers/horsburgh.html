            <h2> <font color="#003366">John Horsburgh (1791-1869)</font></h2>
			<p>John Horsburgh was born
			  in Prestonpans, East Lothian, on 16 November 1791. He attended
			  the Trustees' Academy School of Art in Edinburgh, an institution
		  established in 1760 to teach drawing and design for use
			  in manufacture. In 1805, he was apprenticed to Robert Scott, landscape
			  engraver, for whom he continued to work for some time after his
			  indentures expired. Setting up in his own right, he became known
			  as both a portrait and landscape engraver. Amongst his most successful
			  early works (engraved chiefly in line on copper) are contributions
		  to J.M.W. Turner's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <em>Picturesque
		  Views on the Southern Coast of England</em>			  (1826). He was to remain
		  one of Turner's favoured engravers, also contributing to his <em>Picturesque
		  Views in England and Wales</em> (1825-1838). Turner, however, felt that Horsburgh's
		  particular gift lay in rendering buildings and interiors, and such
		  images soon come to predominate over pure landscape in Horsburgh's
		  production. Another early success, and Horsburgh's first professional
		  encounter with Scott's work, was an  engraving of Sir William Allan's
		  portrait of 
		  <em>Mackay the Actor </em>in a stage adaptation
		  of <em><a href="../../works/novels/robroy.html">Rob
		  Roy</a></em>. Horsburgh's reputation was sufficiently well-established by
		  1826 that he was elected as a founder member (Associate Engraver)
		  of the Royal Scottish Academy. Feeling unequal to the task, though,
		  he resigned after the first meeting and was never re-elected. </p>

			      work in the medium being &#8216;Ponte Sesto, Rome&#8217; after Samuel
			      Prout, for Thomas Roscoe&#8217;s <em>Tourist in Switzerland</em> (1830).
			      In the same year he engraved the <a href="../paintings/images/gordonhorsburgh.html">1830
