            <h4 class="style1"><span class="style1">8) </span>&lsquo;The  Ghostly Afterlives of Walter Scott: Pseudotranslation in an Age of Mechanical Reproduction&rsquo;, Edinburgh History of the Book Seminar by  Dr Tom Toremans, University of Edinburgh, 13 March 2015</h4>
            <p>Hosted by Edinburgh University's <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/chb/about/overview">Centre for the History of the Book</a>, this seminar referred to Ann Rigney&rsquo;s compelling study on <a href="publications/criticism/monographs.html#rigney"><em>The Afterlives of Walter Scott</em></a>   (2012), focusing on a particular phenomenon that   has partially shaped and determined this afterlife but has been largely   neglected by Scott scholarship (and Romantic scholarship in general,   for that matter). Scott himself ironically commented on the phenomenon   of pseudotranslation when in the preface to <a href="works/novels/betrothed.html"><em>The Betrothed</em></a> (1825) he assembled the fictional editors/characters from earlier   Waverley novels (Templeton, Oldbuck, Dryasdust and Clutterbuck) under   the chairmanship of the 'Eidolon, or image of the author' to discuss the   mechanization of the production of Waverley novels. In his vehement   rejection of the proposal Mr Templeton refers to the German Walladmor,   a pseudotranslation he conjectures was probably produced by Herman   Dousterswivel (the German swindler from <a href="works/novels/antiquary.html"><em>The Antiquary</em></a>) by means of a   steam-engine. Such paratextual play with authorship and originality is   not at all uncommon in Scottish Romantic fiction and least of all in   Scott&rsquo;s historical novels. Yet what makes this instance particularly   interesting is its ironic reference to the production of   pseudotranslations of Scott novels across Europe from the early 1820s   onwards. Willibald Alexis's <em>Walladmor</em> (1823-24),   which was in its turn translated into French and Dutch and re-translated   'back' into English by Thomas De Quincey, is only one example among   many. Also posthumously, translations of 'newly discovered' works by   Scott appeared on the European literary markets. This seminar approached   pseudotranslation as a phenomenon that, although primarily commercially   motivated, substantially complicates Romantic notions of originality   and organic literary production, both in its experimentation with   established literary conventions and in its extensive paratextual   enactment of authenticity.</p>
            <p>Dr Toremans is Assistant Professor at <a href="http://www.kuleuven.be/english">Leuven University</a>, Belgium, where he teaches English literature and literary theory.</p>

            <p>2015 marks the bicentenary of the publication of Austen&rsquo;s   <em>Emma</em>, a work that prompted one of Scott&rsquo;s most famous literary reviews.

                <p>This Conference, hosted by the <a href="http://www.stir.ac.uk/">University of   Stirling</a> and the <a href="http://www.strathmartinetrust.org/">Strathmartine Trust</a>, featured a paper by <strong>John Morrison</strong> (Aberdeen) on <strong>'Sir William Allan, Bannockburn and Scottish History'</strong>. Examining  Scott's impact on Scottish history painting, it focused primarily on Sir William Allan, and considered   the paradoxical development of a Unionist history painting when most of   the subjects depicted earlier conflict between the partners in the   Union. Prof. 
                Morrison is the author of <em>Painting the Nation: Identity and 
                Nationalism in Scottish Painting, 1800-1920</em>, which features 
                two chapters on the influence of Scott (see <a href="publications/criticism/2003.html#morrison2003a">Morrison 
                2003a</a> and <a href="publications/criticism/2003.html#morrison2003b">Morrison

            <h4 class="style1">37) 'Walter Scott as a Global Writer?', Comparative Literature Seminar by Prof. Ann Rigney, Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands, 8 October 2014</h4>
            <p>In the first session of <a href="http://www.uu.nl/">Utrecht University</a>'s Comparative Literature Seminar, Prof. Ann Rigney, offered a critical exploration of Scott as a &lsquo;global&rsquo; writer   by examining the productive reception of his work in British-controlled   India. With reference to writers working in Bengali, Urdu and Gujarati,   Rigney aimed to show how Scott&rsquo;s work was translated, adapted, and   appropriated as an imaginative resource in formulating an anti-colonial   counter-memory that Scott himself could not have anticipated but might   perhaps have welcomed. Prof. Rigney holds the Chair of Comparative Literature at Utrecht University; besides many articles on Scott, she is the author of <span id="MainContent_controlProfiel_lblProfieltekst"><em>Imperfect Histories: The Elusive Past and the Legacy of Romantic Historicism</em> (2001) and <em><a href="publications/criticism/monographs.html#rigney">The Afterlives of Walter Scott: Memory on the Move</a></em> (2012).</span></p>

            <p>In the middle of the 19th century, Britain was in the grip of a   protracted and contentious debate about who constituted the nation and   what they shared.&nbsp;As successive Reform Acts more than doubled the   electorate, many were concerned about how to build a new sense of   cultural consensus.&nbsp;One way to do this was to create a pantheon of great   men (and some women) from the past, in an effort to model and promote   forms of cultural consensus for the present.&nbsp;A shared set of heroes   would provide examples of civic virtue and artistic achievement for   emulation.&nbsp;The new pantheon took shape in prominent buildings such as   Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral, but it soon spread across the   rapidly redeveloped cities of London and Edinburgh, and then across the   nation as a whole.&nbsp;As <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/ias/">IAS (Institute of Advanced Studies)</a> Fellow at <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/st-cuthberts.society/">St Cuthbert's Society</a>, Durham University, <strong>Dr Tom Mole</strong> how new   statues of two writers, Byron and  Scott, were positioned in the emerging pantheon and remediated   through the new technology of photography. He&nbsp;showed how their   inclusion in the new&nbsp;pantheon gave material existence, in the present,   to the past shared by the newly-enfranchised subjects of the Reformed   nation.

                  Radio Scotland, 6 May 2013</font></h4>
                <p>To celebrate the return of Rossini's <em>La Donna del Lago</em> 
                  (adapted from Scott's <em><a href="works/novels/lammermoor.html">The 
                  Bride of Lammermoor</a></em>) to the Royal Opera House for the 
                  first time in almost 30 years, James Naughtie argued that Scott 
                  is more relevant now than ever to how Scotland tells the story 
                  of itself and to how it addresses the increasingly pressing 
                  question of what it means to be Scottish. The common view is 
                  that Scott rewrote the story of a small nation and left a trail 
                  of sentimentality and naval-gazing in his wake, but, argued 
                  Naughtie, Scott's branding of Scotland is the mark of a thoroughly 
                  modern thinker and it's been a lot more useful to Scotland than 
                  we might think. While the nation has occasionally struggled 
                  to escape his 'Balmorality', Naughtie believes that Scott reminds 
                  everyone, in countries a long way from Scotland, how important 
                  the idea of a national story can become.</p>

                    of Celtic and Scottish Studies, Edinburgh</a> presented a 
                    workshop journeying deep into the Debatable Lands of the Scottish 
                    Borders, a region steeped in myth and history from which Scott 
                    drew both material and inspiration for his ballad collection 
                    <em><a href="works/poetry/minstrelsy.html">Minstrelsy of the 
                    Scottish Border</a></em>. The event explored the historical 
                    and cultural background of both the area itself and Scott's 
                    creation of the <em>Minstrelsy</em>, while the ballads themselves 
                    were brought to life by traditional singers <strong>Henry 
                    Douglas</strong>, <strong>Naomi Harvey</strong>, <strong>Kathy 
                    Hobkirk</strong>, and <strong>Elsa Lemaitre</strong>. Lucy 
                    MacRae is working on a Ph.D. that looks at collective memory 
                    in the Scottish Borders around 1800, with particular focus 
                    on the cultural context of the <em>Minstrels</em>y texts.

            Through readings of novels by Hogg and Scott, Prof. Jager argued that  religious &lsquo;fanaticism&rsquo; is a by-product of asymmetrical warfare. Hogg's &lsquo;solution&rsquo;  to religiously-motivated violence, he proposed, replaces Scott-style uneven  development with a tentative and shadowy practice of living together. Dr Jager  is Assistant Professor of English at Rutgers University. Among other writings  on Scott, he is author of the monograph <em>Unquiet Things: <br>
            Secularism  in the Romantic Age</em> (2015) (see <a href="publications/criticism/2009.html#jager2009">Jager 2009</a>, <a href="publications/criticism/2011.html#jager2011">Jager 2011</a>, and <a href="publications/criticism/2015.html#jager2015">Jager 2015</a>).

                image, the tomb of the soul. Thus the novelist often chooses to 
                focus only on his characters&#8217; intellectual development, 
                giving the reader so few details about their physical appearance 
                that it is often quite difficult to picture them. Scott demonstrates 
                his lack of interest in the material body even further &#8211; 
                although, in this case he does transcend the dichotomy between 
                body and soul &#8211; when he depicts the spectral body through 
                images of disembodied beings. </p>
              <p align="left">In fact, it appears that what Scott cares little 
                for is not the body itself but ordinary representations of it. 
                He only finds it fascinating when it is either incomplete or immaterial 
                &#8211; as in the case of ghosts for instance &#8211; or, on the 
                contrary, when it is excessively present and materialized, in 
                a Rabelais-like manner, when it is grotesque, misshapen, mutilated, 
                dismembered or transgressive (a cross between male and female 
                or between the human and the animal) or when it has turned into 
                a corpse, embodying the ultimate victory of the matter over the 
                spirit. This paradoxical attitude towards the body probably stems 
                from the mixed feelings of attraction and repulsion which Scott 
                himself experienced through his own infirmity and the repressive 
                spirit of the XIXth century society as a whole. As the body sparks 
                off sexual impulses and carnal desires, it is the inexpressible 
                which must yet be expressed and written but in another form. Apparently 
                absent from Scott&#8217;s texts, sexuality is nonetheless conveyed 
                through transpositions, transfers from the animate to the inanimate 
                as illustrated by the rape of the prison in <a href="works/novels/midlothian.html"><em>The 
                Heart of Mid-Lothian</em></a> or the erotic treatment of the Scottish 
                landscape. </p>
              <p align="left">In a figurative sense the body is also what holds 
                several elements together, what brings together materially distinctive 
                components to form a united and homogenous whole so the notions 
                of domestic or political body and of the body of the nation can 
                also be analyzed, as well as Scott&#8217;s textual body, discussing 
                the ways in which uniqueness and homogeneity are achieved in spite 
                of the various foreign bodies it borrows from.&quot;</p>

              <p align="left">This interdisciplinary conference focussed on the

                impact Scott&#8217;s ballad collection had on Scot(t)land, Europe 
                and Romanticism in general. The keynote speech was delivered by

                and Scotland&#8217;s perception of itself'. Further plenary lectures

              Histories: Jane West&#8217;s <em>The Loyalists </em>(1812)', Fiona 
              Price (Chichester) explored Jane West's unacknowledged role in the

              University, 22 April 2010</font></h4>
            <p align="left"> What is a ballad? What is a song? What is romanticism? 
              What is world literature? And what does the case of Scottish balladry 
              have to say to any of these questions? Ever since the eighteenth-century 
              ballad revival, scholars and songsters have argued about what makes 
              a ballad a ballad, and what makes a Scottish ballad Scottish. Such 
              questions have taken new directions with the emergence of &#8216;world 
              literature.&#8217; Yet all too often discussions of world literature 
              neglect to explore just how such literatures get produced by mobilizing 
              oral traditions. Offering poetic and musical examples, Prof. Maureen 
              McLane (New York) explored the use and abuse of Scottish balladry 
              and song from the eighteenth century until now. Prof. McLane is 
              the author of <em><a href="publications/criticism/monographs.html#mclane">Balladeering, 
              Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry</a></em> (Cambridge

              crisis</a> of 1825-26. In the solitude of his study, facing a lifetime 
              of toil to repay his debts, he wrestles with the ghosts and demons 
              of his and his country&#8217;s past. Click here for a <a href="raggedweb.pdf">poster</a>

                Stirling, 24 October 2009</font></h4>
              <p>Scottish culture and the Gothic have interacted fruitfully with 
                one another ever since the rise of this literary mode during the 
                late eighteenth century. Writers and thinkers of the Scottish 
                Enlightenment such as David Hume, Adam Smith, Henry Mackenzie, 
                James Thomson and James Macpherson were crucial to the discursive 
                foundations of the Gothic aesthetic, while, during the 1790s and 
                early 1800s, Scottish histories and landscapes, however highly 
                mythologised, served as the setting for numerous Gothic romances 
                written and published throughout the British isles. In the first 
                few decades of the nineteenth century, Scottish writers such as 
                James Hogg and Walter Scott interacted with, and modified, Gothic 
                conventions in intriguing and innovative ways, and in the latter 
                part of the century, Robert Louis Stevenson would write and publish 
                what has subsequently become an iconic Gothic text of the fin 
                de si&egrave;cle. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, 
                manifestations of Gothic convention in Scottish literature are 
                no less profound, and contemporary Scottish writers such as Alasdair 
                Gray, Irvine Welsh, Iain Banks and Louise Welsh continue to employ 
                aspects of the Gothic in their work. But these are only some of 
                the best-known names in a rich tradition of Scottish Gothic that 
                stretches back to the latter half of the eighteenth century. Aiming 
                to move beyond a mere consideration of the Gothic in fictions 
                by writers of Scottish nationality, this conference, hosted by 
                the <a href="http://www.english.stir.ac.uk/">Department of English 
                Studies</a> at <a href="http://www.external.stir.ac.uk/">Stirling 
                University</a>, featured papers that explored the use of Gothic 
                conventions in texts about Scotland, its histories and its landscapes, 
                irrespective of their particular cultural provenance. Of particular 
                Scott interest was a plenary lecture by Peter Garside (Edinburgh): 
                'Uncovering Scottish (Gothic) Fiction 1771-1836'. For further

            <p align="left">The 16th Annual Meeting of the <a href="http://icr.byu.edu/">International 
              Conference on Romanticism (ICR)</a> was jointly hosted by <a href="http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/">City 
              College</a> and the <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/">Graduate Center</a> 
              of City University of New York. From Wordsworth&#8217;s description 
              of <em>Lyrical Ballad</em>s as a response to 'the increasing accumulation 
              of men in cities' to Baudelaire&#8217;s location of the impetus 
              for his prose poetry in 'la fr&eacute;quentation des villes &eacute;normes'. 
              the history of Romanticism is bound up with a continuous and evolving 
              response to the emergence of the modern city. As work in a range 
              of areas in our own day leads us to reconsider how we think about 
              such oppositions as nature and culture, the organic and the mechanical, 
              wholeness and multiplicity, the urban text or sub-text of Romanticism 
              presents itself not only as a comparatively neglected area of investigation 
              but as a place to pursue this rethinking. Of particular Scott interest 
              was the President's Address by Nancy Goslee (Tennessee-Knoxville): 
              'Scott's Rhyming Reconsidered: Nationalisms, Romanticisms, and (Maybe) 
              Aesthetics'. Prof. Goslee is author of <em>Scott the Rhymer</em> 
              (University Press of Kentucky, 1988) and numerous articles on Scott.

              period is marked by its striking engagement with the global diversity

              discovery as well as the production of diversity, this conference 
              sought to examine its role in reshaping Romantic culture, thought, 
              society, and knowledge. In addition to many papers of Scott interest,

              landscape has been perceived in creative, historical, canonical, 
              critical, and theoretical terms. Plenary lectures were delivered

              <a href="http://www.hht.net.au/">Historic Houses Trust of New South 
              Wales</a> looking at the life and works of Sir Walter Scott, principally 
              in terms of his relevance to colonial society in Sydney. Most of 
              the significant historic sites in Sydney were designed in the Gothic 
              Revival style, and a riverside suburb is called Abbotsford. On Friday 
              24 November, the Trust hosted a talk in the Library of <a href="http://www.hht.net.au/museums/ebh">Elizabeth 
              Bay House</a> on the life and works of Scott, with visual material 
              to stimulate discussion about his influence on design, a display

            <p><a href="http://www.scottsselkirk.co.uk/">Scott&#8217;s 
              Selkirk</a> was a Millennium project that proved so popular that 
              it has become an established part of the Selkirk calendar. For the 
              first weekend in December, the town centre reverts to Scott's day, 
              with most shopkeepers dressing themselves and their windows appropriately. 
              The Court House is used to re-enact court cases heard by Sir Walter 
              as Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire (see <a href="biography/law.html">Professional 
              Life</a>). There are re-enactments of the False Alarm of 1804 (when 
              the town's men rallied to beacons warning of a French invasion, 
              an event recalled in <em><a href="works/novels/antiquary.html">The 
              Antiquary</a></em>) and of the 1815 Carterhaugh Ba&#8217; Game which 
              was attended by both Sir Walter and James Hogg. This year, besides 
              a variety of street entertainments, there were performances and 
              exhibitions involving Borders Youth Theatre, the Traditional Music 
              School (based at Selkirk High School), Selkirk Film Club, and Selkirk 
              Camera Club. Other attractions included a ceilidh, carol-singing, 
              a Poetry Corner, an Age of Chivalry experience, a Food Court, horse-drawn 
              carriage and Sedan Chair rides, tours of the town, a children&#8217;s

              Of particular interest to students of Scott was a presentation on 
              'Scott and the Borders' by Prof. David Purdie, accompanied by the 
              renowned folksinger Norman Stewart, who interspersed the narrative
