		      <p align="left"><font size="4">My dear Miss Edgeworth,&#8212;I received
		          your acknowlegement this day which is more than a hundred of
		          the volumes acknowledged. I am afraid that I shall [riot] greatly
		          master
		          the self conceit it is likely to excite by deducting one half
		          of your praise and setting it to the account of your partiality
		          for the author for I am not sure if that is likely to diminish
		          my self
		          value but on the contrary I think it very like to increase
		          it. Now though there is such a petition in our old fashiond
		          Scots litany
		          as &quot;Lord send us all a good conceit of ourselves&quot; yet
		          as the doze may be very easily increased to a dangerous [one]
		          I had better answer your letter before its full operation on
		          my pericranium. </font></p>
		      <p align="left"><font size="4">Seriously my own best thoughts of any
		          thing I ever wrote never went beyond my excellent friend Sir
		          Robert Dundas's (whom you saw I think in our House in Castle
		          Street) approbation
		          of a good joke which he expresses in these words at the utmost &quot;Thats
		          not bad.&quot; Adam Fergusson &amp; I have shot jest upon jest in
		          hopes to carry a little forth but it was always the same sort
		          of laugh and the same limited approbation. Now I claim credit
		          as an
		          honest man when I tell you that almost all things I have written
		          even those which the public has received best have been so
		          much inferior to that which I would like to have done that
		          I am always disgusted
		          with them for the time at least&#8212;Years afterwards when the ideas
		          out of which the story was produced have been entirely forgotten
		          I have been much better pleased with them. I fancy something
		          like this may occur to other authors. With me it is a very
		          strong feeling
		          and leads to a little reluctance to speak or think about these
		          things unless to a friend like yourself who will not readily
		          suspect me
		          of affectation.</font></p>
