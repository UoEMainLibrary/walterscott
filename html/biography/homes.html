              was born on 15 August 1771 in a third-floor flat in College Wynd 
              in the Old Town of Edinburgh. College Wynd climbed from the Grassmarket 
              to the gates of the old University of Edinburgh. Scott's birthplace 
              was pulled down a few years later to make room for the northern 
              front of the new college building (now, confusingly, known as Old 
              College). Although a favoured address for lecturers and professional 
              men such as Scott's father (see <a href="origins.html">Family Background</a>), 
              College Wynd was a cramped, dimly lit alleyway with poor sanitation 
              and little fresh air. Such unhealthy conditions undoubtedly contributed 
              to the death in childhood of six of his siblings. Scott himself 
              developed polio, and in 1773 was sent to recover in the country 
              air of Sandyknowe. (Click on the thumbnail to view a full-size image 
              of College Wynd in 1870.) </p>
            <p>Sandyknowe Farm, belonging to Scott's grandfather Robert Scott, 
              lay on the outskirts of the village of Smailholm, Roxburghshire. 
              It was located some thirty miles southeast of Edinburgh and roughly 
              halfway between Kelso and Melrose. His time there would prove highly 
              formative, instilling him with a lifelong love of the ballads, traditions, 
              and landscape of the Border region (see <a href="sandy.html">Sandyknowe 
              and Early Childhood</a>). Returning occasionally to Edinburgh and 
              making lengthy visits to Bath and Prestonpans to attempt a water 
              cure for his lameness, Scott would remain at Sandyknowe until early 
              1778. By that stage, Scott's father judged his health sufficiently 
              firm to permit him to start school in Edinburgh (see <a href="education.html">School 
              and University</a>).</p>

              thus moved back to Edinburgh to join his family in their spacious 
              new home at 25 George Square. George Square was a new residential 
              development built by James Brown outside the old city walls. It 
              catered for the professional classes who were beginning to abandon 
              the cramped streets of the Old Town for lighter, airier accommodation. 
              Scott's father, who had now risen to sole head of his firm, was 
              one of the first to have a house built there. His neighbours were 
              a distinguished set, including the Countess of Sutherland, Lord 
              Braxfield, the Justice-Clerk of the Court, and Henry Dundas, the 
              future Lord Melville. This was to remain Scott's home until his 
              marriage in 1797. From here he attended Edinburgh High School and 
              then Edinburgh University, finally qualifying as an Advocate in 
              1792 (see <a href="education.html">School and University</a> and 
              <a href="law.html">Professional Life</a>). 25 George Square is currently 
              the seat of the Dominican Priory of St. Albert the Great, the Catholic 
              Chaplaincy to Edinburgh University and Edinburgh College of Art.</p>

              December 24, 1797, Scott married Charlotte Carpenter (see <a href="marriage.html">Williamina, 
              Charlotte, and Marriage</a>). The newly-weds initially rented a 
              house at 50 George Street then in autumn 1798 moved to 10 South 
              Castle Street. Here Charlotte would give birth to two children, 
              Charlotte Sophia on October 24, 1799, and Walter on October 28, 
              1801. Shortly after Walter's birth, the young family moved into 
              a house that Scott had had built at 39 North Castle Street. A spacious, 
              three-story, gray-stone dwelling, this would remain Scott's Edinburgh 
              home until financial disaster struck in 1826 (see <a href="finance.html">Financial 
              Hardship</a>). It is currently occupied by a firm of solicitors. 
              (Click on the thumbnail to see a full-size image of 39 North Castle

            <p><img src="graphics/lasswade.jpg" width="250" height="165" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Lasswade Cottage, photogravure after unknown artist, 1903 (Corson.B.CAW.2)">Scott's
              Edinburgh home was only his winter residence. From 1798 to 1803,
              he summered in a cottage on the outskirts of Lasswade, a village
              six miles south-east of Edinburgh on the river Esk. Many of Scott's
              friends had country residences in its vicinity, including the novelist
              Henry Mackenzie, and his old history teacher Alexander Fraser Tytler.
                As well as
                exchanging
                visits with these, Scott entertained a number of literary guests,
                including, in 1803, William and Dorothy Wordsworth. It was at
              Lasswade that Scott began his career as an author, translating
              verse and
                drama from the German, and writing his own first original ballads,
                one of which, 'The Gray Brother', celebrates the countryside
              around Lasswade (see <a href="beginning.html">Literary Beginnings</a>).
                 It was here too that Scott wrote the opening stanzas of his
              first
              great poetic success, <a href="../works/poetry/minstrel.html"><i>The
              Lay of the Last Minstrel</i></a>. </p>
            <p>On December 16, 1799, Scott became Sheriff Depute of Selkirkshire 
              (see <a href="law.html">Professional Life</a>). This was a seasonal 
              post, requiring his presence from mid-July to mid-November and permitting 
              him to spend the rest of the year in Edinburgh. There was, however, 
              a rarely enforced law of residence stipulating that the Sheriff 
              Depute live in Selkirkshire for four months of the year. Initially 
              Scott based himself at an inn in Clovenfords for the duration of 
              the circuit. Eventually, though, he felt that it would be politic 
              to find a family house in Selkirkshire. Accordingly, in 1804, he 
              gave up Lasswade and leased the property of Ashestiel, six miles 
              from Selkirk on the south bank of the Tweed. </p>
            <p><a href="ashestiel.html"><img src="graphics/ashestiel2.jpg" width="214" height="250" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Ashestiel, engraved by John Horsburgh after J.M.W. Turner, 1880 (O.S. .82373)"></a>Ashestiel 
              (sometimes written Ashiestiel) had belonged to Scott's uncle William 
              Russell, whose heir now dwelled in India. It had originally been 
              an old Border tower, part of which is still enclosed in the centre 
              of the house. Scott's aunt Mrs Russell (his mother's sister) had 
              added a west wing, turning it into an oddly shaped three-cornered 
              building. Built for defence, it was protected to the north by the 
              Tweed and to the east by a deep ravine. It was here that Scott wrote 
              the works that would bring him poetic fame, <i>The Lay of the Last 
              Minstrel</i>, <i><a href="../works/poetry/marmion.html">Marmion</a></i>, 
              and <a href="../works/poetry/lady.html"><i>The Lady of the Lake</i></a> 
              (See <a href="poet.html">Scott the Poet</a>). Ashestiel itself is 
              immortalized in the epistles to friends which preface each of the 
              six cantos of <i>Marmion</i>, where Scott describes the effects 
              of the changing seasons upon its scenery. Ashestiel also saw Scott 
              begin the next phase of his literary career with the first abortive 
              draft of <a href="../works/novels/waverley.html"><i>Waverley</i></a> 
              in 1805 (see <a href="novel.html">Scott the Novelist</a>). (Click 
              on the thumbnail to see a full-size image of Ashestiel as portrayed 
              by J.M.W. Turner.)</p>
            <p>The lease at Ashestiel ran out in May 1811. In a letter of July 
              1, 1811 to his friend John Morrit, Scott wrote that he had 'bought 
              a small farm value about &pound;150 yearly with the intention of 
              &quot;bigging myself a bower&quot; after my own fashion'. This farm 
              was Cartley (nicknamed 'Clarty') Hole Farm, situated in the Borders 
              between Kelso and Melrose, which Scott would rename Abbotsford.</p>

            <p><a name="abbotsford"></a>Abbotsford originally comprised 110 acres but grew exponentially 
              as Scott bought up neighbouring property such as Abbotslee (1812) 
              and Kaeside (1816) at inflated prices. By 1825, it was ten times 
              its original size. The buildings too had been radically transformed. 
              First, in 1812 Scott had built a 'cottage' for family residence 
              (for an image of which see the <a href="finance.html">Financial 
              Hardship</a> page). A first expansion (1816-18) saw the addition 
              of a square western tower and the present dining room and parlour, 
              turning Abbotsford into a rural villa. Soon, however, the house 
              became too small for the ever-expanding land and for the accommodation 
              of Scott's innumerable guests that included Maria Edgeworth, Joanna 
              Baillie, J.M.W. Turner and Washington Irving. Upon accepting a baronetcy 
              in 1818, Scott also felt that the house was no longer in keeping 
              with his new dignity. In winter 1821 he began a second phase of 
              building, demolishing the cottage and building a two-story manor 
              house in its place. </p>
            <p>Beginning with Virginia Woolf, many commentators have seen Abbotsford 
              as an echo of the blending of ancient and modern that Scott attempts 
              in his written works. Externally, it resembles a Scottish fortified 
              house of the sixteenth century, with turreted towers, high chimneys, 
              and a castellated fringe. The interior is filled with relics of 
              both national and family history: heraldic devices, suits of armour, 
              old weaponry (including Rob Roy's long-barrelled gun, pouch and 
              dirk), and paintings, collected or commissioned, of Scott's forebears. 
              In other respects, though, Scott was remarkably forward-looking, 
              installing a pneumatic bell system, water closets, and extensive 
              gas lighting (on which some commentators have blamed his poor health). 
              It proved immeasurably influential on nineteenth-century building 
              styles, sparking the Victorian revival of Scots-Baronial architecture.</p>

            <p>Scott's 'plaything in stone' came at a great expense to himself 
              and his publishers. After its completion in 1824, Scott had barely 
              a year to enjoy his realized vision before financial disaster struck. 
              To finance Abbotsford, he had taken advances from his publisher 
              Archibald Constable for a number of volumes on which he had yet 
              to begin work. He had also raised a number of loans in the names 
              of James Ballantyne and Co. (which he fully owned from 1816 to 1822). 
              This contributed to draining the liquid capital of both businesses, 
              leaving them powerless to resist collapse in the financial crash 
              of 1826 (see <a href="finance.html">Financial Hardship</a>). Scott 
              found himself in debt to the tune of &pound;120,000 but had had 
              the foresight to settle Abbotsford upon his newly-married son in 
              1825. According to Scots Law as it then stood, it was thus beyond 
              the reach of Scott's creditors. The marriage settlement contained 
              a clause granting Scott a life-rent. Although Scott was forced to 
              sell his Edinburgh property at 39 North Castle Street, he was able 
              to continue living in Abbotsford until his death in 1832.</p>
            <p>Abbotsford now stands as a national monument to Scott. His study, 
              library (containing 9,000 rare volumes), drawing room, entrance 
              hall, armouries, and dining room are open to visitors. For details,
