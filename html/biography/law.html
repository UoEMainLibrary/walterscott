			<h2><font color="#003366">Professional Life</font></h2>
			<p>On March 31, 1786, after two years at <a href="education.html">Edinburgh 
              University</a>, Scott entered his father's office to begin his apprenticeship 
              to the profession of Writer to the Signet. It had not yet been decided 
              whether he would eventually follow his father's career or instead 
              aim for the Bar. His father, though, felt that a Writer's technical 
              training would be useful even if Scott should choose the latter 
              path. Though Scott disliked the tedious clerical tasks that he was 
              set, his ambition and filial devotion made him a diligent and quick-witted 
              apprentice. Through his father's many Highland clients, he made 
              his first acquaintance with the culture and traditions that were 
              to figure so prominently in works such as <i><a href="../works/poetry/lady.html">The 
              Lady of the Lake</a></i>, <a href="../works/novels/waverley.html"><i>Waverley</i></a>, 
              and <i><a href="../works/novels/robroy.html">Rob Roy</a></i>. A 
              case involving one client, the Jacobite veteran, Alexander Stewart 
              of Invernahyle, who claimed to have fought a duel with Rob Roy, 
              permitted Scott to visit the Highland region for the first time. 
              The desolate and picturesque scenes through which he traveled were 
              to make a lasting impression on his poetic imagination. </p>

				<td width="55%">With his father's support, Scott soon resolved 
                  to aim for the Bar. After attending lectures in Moral Philosophy 
                  and Universal History (see <a href="education.html">School and 
                  University</a>) in 1790-91, he enrolled in a Scots Law class 
                  at Edinburgh University in 1790-91. His lecturer was David Hume, 
                  nephew of the philosopher and the major writer on criminal law 
                  in Scotland during the late Enlightenment period. Hume's<i> 
                  </i>greatest achievement was the<i> Commentaries on the Law 
                  of Scotland: Respecting Crimes</i>, a<i> </i>systematic exposition 
                  of Scots Law which, as an institutional writing, remains an 
                  authoritative legal source. Scott was greatly impressed by Hume's 
                  powers of synthesis and historical analysis.</td>

				  <p>After a further year studying Roman Law, Scott successfully 
                    passed his examinations and called as an Advocate on July 
                    11, 1792. On his father's advice, he had dedicated his thesis 
                    to Lord Braxfield, their neighbour in George Square and Lord 
                    Justice-Clerk of the Supreme Criminal Court of Scotland. Braxton 
                    enjoyed a fearsome reputation as a scourge of Jacobins and 
                    was the model for Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>. 
                    This tactic paid off as Braxfield, flattered and impressed 
                    by Scott's thesis, helped him to find work on the Jedburgh 
                    circuit. </p>

			<p>Scott's experiences as a fledgling Advocate are echoed in those 
              of Alan Fairford in his 1824 novel <a href="../works/novels/redgaun.html"><i>Redgauntlet</i></a> 
              which provides a vivid picture of Parliament House (home to the 
              Faculty of Advocates and the Court of Session) in the late eighteenth 
              century. The appearance of Parliament House changed dramatically 
              in Scott's lifetime. The original seventeenth-century building was 
              refaced in a neoclassical style at the beginning of the nineteenth 
              century, and further modifications were carried out after the great 
              fire in 1824. Something of its appearance at the time of Scott's 
              calling is captured in a sketch (below) by Scott's friend and fellow 
              Advocate, James Skene of Rubislaw. (For more on the Faculty of Advocates and Parliament House, see <a href="#links">Links</a> at the foot of this page.) </p>
			<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/parliament.jpg" width="350" height="201" alt="The Parliament Close, etched from a drawing by James Skene, 1829 (Corson B.SKE.3)"></p>
			<p>During the early years of his practice Scott worked exclusively 
              on provincial circuits. His first Edinburgh case was not heard until 
              July 1795. His earnings grew modestly during this period, but worryingly 
              for Scott, more than half his work came from his father's connections. 
              Following his <a href="marriage.html">marriage</a> in 1797, there 
              was a growing need for a more stable source of income. This became 
              all the more pressing after the birth of his first child, Sophia, 
              in 1799. While collecting ballads for what would eventually become 
              <a href="../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html"> <i>Minstrelsy of the 
              Scottish Border</i></a>, he had received some help from an amateur 
              antiquarian, Andrew Plummer, Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire. Plummer's 
              health was rapidly failing, and with his support and that of Duke 
              of Buccleuch, Scott went to London to petition Henry Dundas, controller 
              of Crown patronage in Scotland, to be named as Plummer's successor. 
              He was appointed on December 16, 1799, and remained in the post 
              until his death. To mark the centenary of Scott's death in 1932, 
              a memorial was erected outside the Town Hall in Selkirk (for an image, see <a href="#links">Links</a> at the foot of this page). Scott's 
              courtroom in the same building has been preserved as a museum and 
              is open to the public.</p>
			<p><img src="../graphics/selkirk.jpg" width="250" height="176" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Selkirk, engraved by W. Miller after P. Paton, 1877 (Corson P.1676)">As 
              Sheriff-Depute, Scott's role was essentially that of a county judge. 
              The post presented several advantages. It brought an annual income 
              of &pound;300, required only a seasonal presence in Selkirkshire, 
              permitted him to reside in Edinburgh for most of the year, and did 
              not prevent him from continuing to practise as an Advocate. From 
              now on, he would spend the winter and summer in Edinburgh and from 
              mid-July to mid-November perform his duties at Selkirk. The appointment 
              also provided ample opportunity for ballad-collecting in nearby 
              Ettrickdale.</p>
			<p>Nonetheless, as Scott's family grew, he again began to worry about 
              his financial security. In 1805, he was awaiting the birth of his 
              fourth child Charles. The <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> 
              and the recently published <i><a href="../works/poetry/minstrel.html">The 
              Lay of the Last Minstrel</a></i> had brought him his first taste 
              of success as a writer. Literary earnings, though, were notoriously 
              precarious, and Scott was becoming increasingly pessimistic about 
              his career prospects as an Advocate. He believed that his literary 
              ambitions were alienating clients and professional colleagues and 
              saw only a distant possibility of being appointed to the judiciary. 
              He decided, therefore, to seek a salaried post. </p>
			<p>One of the Principal Clerks of the Court of Session, George Home 
              of Wedderburn, was having increasing difficulty in performing his 
              work due to encroaching deafness. His post held out many attractions 
              for Scott. It brought &pound;800 a year, it would not force him 
              to resign his Selkirk sheriffdom, and would consume only between 
              four and six hours a day during the six months that the Court was 
              in session. Scott offered to assume Home's labours and to allow 
              him the entire salary for his lifetime. His appointment was secured 
              on March 8, 1806.</p>

                  authorities. These were no mechanical, clerical tasks; each 
                  element of Scott's work required considerable erudition. Scott 
                  was sketched at his work as Clerk of Session by his fellow Advocate 
                  Robert Scott Moncrieff (right) in an image which contrasts starkly

			<p>For the rest of his life, Scott combined extensive writing and

              legal career, a statue of a seated Scott by John Greenshields (1792-1835)
