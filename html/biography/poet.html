                  years at the High School of Edinburgh (see <a href="education.html">School 
                  and University</a>), his first original verse was not published 
                  until 1799, when the <a href="ballant.html">Ballantyne Press</a> 
                  brought out a private edition of the ballad 'The Eve of St. 
                  John'. A year later, <a href="../works/poetry/apology/poets.html#monk">Matthew
                  Gregory Lewis</a>'s long-delayed anthology 
                  <i>Tales of Wonder</i> contained two more original Scott ballads 
                  'The Fire King' and 'Glenfinlas' (illustrated, left), together 
                  with a reprint of 'The Eve of St. John' (see <a href="beginning.html">Literary

			<p align="left"><a name="minstrelsy"></a>Scott's true debut in the literary world, though, 
              was marked by the <a href="../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html"><i>Minstrelsy 
              of the Scottish Border</i></a>, a collection of the traditional 
              ballads that Scott had been collecting in yearly trips to the Borders 
              from 1792 onwards. In many cases, Scott had not hesitated to 'improve' 
              upon the original, changing words, inserting new stanzas, mending 
              rhymes and rhythms, fusing various versions, and sometimes setting 
              old legends to verses of his own. The first two-volume edition of 
              the <i>Minstrelsy</i> (1802) also contained two previously published 
              imitation ballads, 'Glenfinlas' and 'The Eve of St John', and a 
              concluding 'Third Part' to the traditional ballad 'Thomas the Rhymer' 
              of Scott's own composition.</p>

                <td width="53%">In 1803, the second edition of the <i>Minstrelsy</i> 
                  was published, including a third volume of modern ballads by 
                  a number of leading writers. These included four further Scott 
                  compositions: 'Cadyow Castle' (illustrated, right), 'The Gray 
                  Brother', 'War Song of the Royal Edinburgh Light Dragoons', 
                  and 'Christie's Will'. The <i>Minstrelsy</i> was a commercial 
                  triumph. The first edition sold out in six months, laying the 
                  foundation for <a href="ballant.html">James Ballantyne</a>'s 
                  career as a printer. It was translated into German, Danish, 
                  and Swedish, and gave Scott his first taste of North American 
                  success. </td>

			<p>Scott had originally intended to include in the <i>Minstrelsy</i> 
              a transcription of <i>Sir Tristrem</i>, an incomplete medieval narrative 
              romance, based on the legend of Tristram and Iseult, that formed 
              part of the Auchinleck MS in the Advocates' Library. As the <i>Minstrelsy</i> 
              rapidly expanded, he decided to publish it separately, along with 
              arguments attributing it to the thirteenth-century poet Thomas of 
              Ercildoune. When it appeared, however, in 1804, the fifteen-stanza 
              conclusion was furnished by Scott himself in skillful imitation 
              of the original poet's style.</p>
			<p><img src="../graphics/minstrel2.jpg" width="250" height="162" align="left" alt="The Lay of the Last Minstrel, engraved by John Pye after Richard Westall, 1809 (Corson H.WES.3)" hspace="10">A 
              further offshoot of the <i>Minstrelsy</i> was to develop into Scott's 
              first major narrative poem. Among the imitation ballads that he 
              had intended to include in the third volume was a lengthy piece 
              interweaving a tale of sixteenth-century Border rivalry with the 
              supernatural legends of the wizard Michael Scott and his goblin 
              servant Gilpin Horner. The poem rapidly grew too long for inclusion 
              in the <i>Minstrelsy</i>, and Scott began to conceive of it as a 
              separate volume. Published in 1805, the <a href="../works/poetry/minstrel.html"><i>Lay 
              of the Last Minstrel</i></a> enjoyed unprecedented sales for a work 
              of poetry and brought Scott instant fame. Critics and public applauded 
              Scott's skill in shaking off the stiffness of neo-classical verse 
              while refining the perceived coarseness of the ballad tradition. 
              The description of the moonlit Melrose Abbey (Canto II, stanza 1) 
              brought a stream of sightseers to its ruins and was the first instance 
              of Scott's immense impact on the nineteenth-century tourist industry. 
              The <i>Lay</i>'s success determined the line that Scott's work was 
              to take over the next nine years as he produced a succession of 
              major narrative poems.</p>
			<p><img src="../graphics/neidpath.jpg" width="250" height="177" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Neidpath Castle on the Tweed, engraved by Charles Heath after George Cattermole, 1835 (Corson P.1539)">He 
              nonetheless continued to compose shorter ballads based primarily 
              on Border traditions. William Whyte's miscellany <i>A Collection 
              of Scottish Airs</i> (1806-07) contains five pieces by Scott, all 
              of which were destined to become much re-printed anthology pieces: 
              'Helvellyn', 'The Maid of Toro', 'The Maid of Neidpath' (illustrated, 
              right), 'The Palmer', and 'Wandering Willie'. Scott's own 1806 collection 
              <i>Ballads and Lyrical Pieces</i> contained eleven previously published 
              pieces, together with 'The Norman Horse-Shoe' and 'The Dying Bard', 
              which had only previously appeared in a privately printed pre-publication 
              issue of the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>. In 1808 too, he inserted 
              two ballads of his own, 'Hunting Song' and 'Bridal Song', into his 
              edition of Joseph Strutt's historical romance <i>Queenhoo-Hall</i>.</p>

              most concerted poetic effort during these years, however, went into 
              his second narrative poem <i><a href="../works/poetry/marmion.html">Marmion</a></i>, 
              set against the backdrop of Scotland's greatest military defeat, 
              the battle of Flodden Field. In the title character, Scott created 
              a new kind of anti-hero, an ambiguous mixture of villainy and open-hearted 
              courage that would greatly influence the protagonists of Byron. 
              On its publication in 1808, the critics were thrown by this disconcerting 
              figure, judging him an altogether unsuitable subject for poetic 
              celebration. The public, though, were conquered, turning <i>Marmion</i> 
              into an even greater commercial success than the <i>Lay of the Last 
              Minstrel</i>. Scott's fame had now reached such a height that his 
              publisher Constable was able to commission a portrait of the poet 
              from the celebrated painter <a href="../portraits/artists/raeburn.html">Sir
              Henry Raeburn</a> (engraved by <a href="../portraits/engravers/horsburgh.html">John
              Horsburgh</a>, above left).</p>
			<p><img src="../graphics/lady2.jpg" width="189" height="250" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Lady of the Lake, engraved by Francis Engleheart after Richard Westall, 1811 (Corson H.WES.4)">Scott's 
              next narrative poem <i><a href="../works/poetry/lady.html">The Lady 
              of the Lake</a></i> (1810) would mark the pinnacle of his career 
              as a poet. Set along the shores and islands of Loch Katrine, where 
              Scott holidayed in August 1809, it dramatized the struggle between 
              James V, sixteenth-century king of Scotland, and the powerful clan 
              Douglas. Scott's aim was to rely less on spectacular action and 
              scenery than on psychologically convincing characterization. For 
              once, the critics were as enthusiastic as the public, praising Scott's 
              depiction of 'real manners'. With 25,000 copies exhausted in eight 
              months, <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> (illustrated, right) broke all 
              records for the sale of poetry. For all Scott's desire to play down 
              the 'local colour' element, the poem created a tourist vogue for 
              Loch Katrine and the Trossachs which has endured to this day.</p>
			<p>Scott's next lengthy poem, <i><a href="../works/poetry/donroderick.html">The 
              Vision of Don Roderick</a> </i>(1811), was essentially an occasional 
              production, written to celebrate<i> </i>Wellington's successes in 
              the Peninsular Campaign, with all profits to be donated to Portuguese 
              war sufferers. Scott himself dismissed the poem upon its appearance 
              as a piece of patriotic tub-thumping. The critics felt it to be 
              a series of tableaux rather than a genuinely compelling narrative, 
              but it was favourably greeted by the public, earning one hundred 
              guineas for the Portuguese fund. </p>
			<p><img src="../graphics/byron.jpg" width="177" height="250" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Lord Byron, engraved by W.E. West after T.A. Dean, 1830 (.82176 Gal.)">Scott 
              had a good deal more invested in its follow-up, 1813's <i><a href="../works/poetry/rokeby.html">Rokeby</a></i>. 
              Funds were urgently required to finance the building of his new 
              home at <a href="homes.html">Abbotsford</a> and to counter the emerging 
              financial difficulties of John Ballantyne and Co, in which Scott 
              was a silent half-partner (see <a href="finance.html">Financial 
              hardship</a>). Fearing that he might have sated the public's appetite 
              for Scottish historical romances, he set his new poem in England, 
              in the midst of the Civil War. For any other poet, <i>Rokeby</i> 
              would have been a considerable commercial success but sales fell 
              far short of <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> and failed to meet Scott's 
              increasingly urgent needs. The critics, conversely, were highly 
              favourable, but Scott began to sense that his poetic star was on 
              the wane. He now had a formidable rival in Lord Byron (portrayed 
              above), whose <i>Child Harold's Pilgrimage</i> (1812) had eclipsed 
              even Scott's early successes. The conviction that he could not compete 
              with Byron, whose work Scott always intensely admired, influenced 
              the decision to experiment with prose narrative (see <a href="novel.html">Scott 
              the novelist</a>).</p>
			<p align="left">It was nonetheless at this point, in autumn 1813, 
              that the Prince Regent offered Scott the vacant post of Poet Laureate. 
              Scott immediately felt that such an appointment would be a poisoned 
              chalice. The Laureateship had fallen into disrepute, as a succession 
              of poetasters had churned out conventional and obsequious odes on 
              royal occasions. Given, too, that Scott already occupied two public 
              offices, as Sheriff Depute of Selkirkshire and Clerk of the Court 
              of Session (see <a href="law.html">Professional Career</a>), he 
              might be accused of greed. On the other hand, it was a great honour 
              that could not be lightly turned down, royal favour might assist 
              his children's careers, and the salary would unquestionably alleviate 
              his present difficulties. </p>

                  The Duke echoed Scott's own reservations and warned Scott to

                  down the offer, requesting that the post be offered to a needier 
                  writer who lived entirely by his pen. Through his friend John

			<p>While concentrating on longer verse narratives, Scott had still 
              been publishing shorter songs and ballads in journals and anthologies. 
              He contributed five pieces to John Ballantyne's 1810 miscellany 
              <i>English Minstrelsy</i> and a series of poetic imitations to the 
              <i>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1809 </i>(published 1811). These 
              last included not only pastiches of Crabbe and Moore but a parody 
              of his own style in 'The Vision of Triermain'. Indulging a lifelong 
              love of mystification, he expanded the 'Vision' into a lengthier 
              poem, <a href="../works/poetry/triermain.html"><i>The Bridal of 
              Triermain</i></a> which wove together Arthurian and medieval legends 
              of an enchanted castle in the English Lake District. Published anonymously, 
              <i>The Bridal </i> fooled almost all critics into thinking that 
              it was an imitation of Scott rather than by Scott himself (though 
              some thought it surpassed its model!).</p>
			<p><img src="../graphics/lord3.jpg" width="159" height="250" align="left" hspace="10" alt="The Lord of the Isles, engraved by E. Goodall after J.M.W. Turner, 1857 (Corson A.4.LOR.1.a.1857/1)">By 
              now, though, Scott's major efforts had turned to prose. 1814 saw 
              the publication of his first novel <a href="../works/novels/waverley.html"><i>Waverley</i></a>, 
              an immediate success which persuaded Scott that his future lay in 
              that line. He was to produce, though, one last major poetic work.<i> 
              The <a href="../works/poetry/lord.html">Lord of the Isles</a></i> 
              (1815) grew from a fragment dealing with the wanderings of Robert 
              the Bruce that Scott had abandoned in favour of <i>Rokeby</i>. A 
              voyage around the Western Isles in summer and autumn 1814 rekindled 
              his inspiration, introducing Scott to the locations that are vividly 
              described in the poem's dense narrative. After a worryingly slow 
              start, the first edition sold out within a month but once again 
              did not match the success of <i>Marmion</i> and <i>The Lady of the 
              Lake</i>. Although for some critics it was amongst Scott's best 
              work, others saw evidence of over-hasty composition, loose plotting 
              and versification, and an exhausted vein of inspiration.</p>
			<p>From now on, Scott would essentially be 'the author of Waverley'. 
              Two further minor poetic narratives were published but with modest 
              critical and commercial success. <a href="../works/poetry/waterloo.html"><i>The 
              Field of Waterloo</i></a> (1815) was based on Scott's visit to the 
              battlefield shortly after Napoleon's defeat. Profits went to a fund 
              set up for widows and orphans of soldiers, and sales were respectable. 
              While some commentators were reluctant to criticize a poem produced 
              in a worthy cause, others did not hesitate to censure it in the 
              harshest terms for its clumsy structure and stilted phrasing. Finally,<i> 
              <a href="../works/poetry/harold.html">Harold the Dauntless</a></i> 
              (1817), the tale of a Viking Beserker, was published as another 
              work by 'the author of the Bridal of Triermain'. Again, few critics 
              detected Scott's hand, judging it rather a second-rate imitation 
              which magnified the faults of its model. Such comments, combined 
              with poor sales, merely confirmed Scott in his decision to specialize 
              henceforth in prose fiction.</p>
			<p>While he contained to contribute to journals and miscellanies (such 
              as <i>A Select Collection of Original Irish Airs </i>and <i>Albyn's 
              Anthology</i>) and would later write the poetic dramas <i>Halidon 
              Hill </i>(1822) and <i>The Doom of Devorgoil </i>(1830), the main 
              vent for Scott's poetic Muse would now be the lyrics and poetic 
              fragments inserted into his novels. Today, with the vogue for Scott's 
              narrative verse not long outliving the nineteenth century, his reputation 
              as a poet rests largely on such widely anthologized lyrics as 'Proud 
              Maisie' (<a href="../works/novels/midlothian.html"><i>The Heart 
              of Midlothian</i></a>) and 'Lucy Ashton's Song' (<a href="../works/novels/lammermoor.html"><i>The 
              Bride of Lammermoor</i></a>).</p>
