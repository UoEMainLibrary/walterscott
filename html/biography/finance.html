            <h2><font color="#003366">Financial Hardship</font></h2>
            <p>Scott suffered two major financial crises, in 1813 and 1825-26, 
              both sparked by the collapse of his publishers:</p>

            <h3><font color="#003366"> <a name="1813"></a>1. The Fall of John 
              Ballantyne and Co. (1813)</font></h3>
            <p>In 1809, Scott had broken with Archibald Constable and helped to 
              set up the rival publishing house of John Ballantyne and Co. (see 
              <a href="ballant.html">The Ballantyne Brothers</a>). Scott obtained 
              a half-share in this new business, and the Ballantyne brothers, 
              John and James acquired a quarter share each. Profits were to be 
              divided in the same proportion, and policy to be decided jointly. 
              In practice, however, Scott, who had loaned an additional &pound;1,500 
              to increase the business's liquid assets, made all major decisions 
              and determined which titles should be published. Like Scott's involvement 
              with James Ballantyne's printing house, his participation in this 
              new enterprise was a closely guarded secret.</p>
            <p><img src="graphics/seward.jpg" width="192" height="250" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Anna Seward, photogravure after John Opie, 1903 (Corson B.CAW.1)">In 
              May 1810 John Ballantyne and Co. published Scott's <a href="../works/poetry/lady.html"><i>The 
              Lady of the Lake</i></a>, the immense success of which led the three 
              partners into a wildly optimistic assessment of their prospects. 
              The profits, however, were not ploughed back into the business, 
              and Scott selected a series of financially disastrous titles for 
              publication where loyalty or personal esteem for the author outweighed 
              cold commercial logic. 1810, for example, saw the publication of 
              a posthumous three-volume edition of the poems of Anna Seward, 'the 
              Swan of Lichfield', one of Scott's great correspondents. Seward 
              (portrayed, right) had appointed him her literary executor with 
              instructions to bring out her collected works, most of which Scott 
              himself judged 'absolutely execrable' (letter to Joanna Baillie, 
              March 18, 1810). Equally unsuccessful were Scott's friend John Jamieson's 
              <i>The Historical Account of the Ancient Culdees of Iona </i>(1811) 
              and a fourteen-volume edition of the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher 
              (1812). </p>
            <p>Another long-cherished Scott project, however, proved the chief 
              drain on the firm's resources. The <i>Edinburgh Annual Register</i> 
              began with encyclopedic ambitions and an impressive list of contributors. 
              Each volume was originally to include an account of world events 
              in the year covered, followed by surveys of developments in the 
              spheres of literature, science, fine arts, 'useful arts', meteorology, 
              and commerce. It suffered, however, from desultory and inconsistent 
              editing (at the hands of Scott and James Ballantyne) and fell well 
              short of its ambitions. It failed to print most of the advertized 
              essays, always appeared at least two years late, and was too politically 
              partisan for an annual publication. By 1812, it was losing &pound;1,000 
              a year. Such errors of commercial judgment were to prove fatal in 
              a war-ravaged economic climate marked by banking crises and the 
              increasing unavailability of credit.<br>

            <p> In 1811, as unsold stock gathered in dust in the warehouse , Scott 
              paid the exorbitant price of &pound;4,200 for Cartley Hole Farm, 
              the property which he was soon to expand into the estate of <a href="homes.html">Abbotsford</a>. 
              He borrowed half the sum from his brother Major John Scott, and 
              the rest was raised by John Ballantyne on the security of <a href="../works/poetry/rokeby.html"><i>Rokeby</i></a>, 
              the as yet unwritten poem on which Scott was banking to restore 
              the fortunes of the publishing house. When, in 1813, sales of the 
              completed poem proved disappointing, the financial standing of John 
              Ballantyne and Co. fell so low that no bank would extend it a further 
              loan. Worse still, the publishing house was threatening to drag 
              James Ballantyne's printing house down with it. The Ballantyne Press, 
              in fact, was John Ballantyne and Co.'s principal creditor, having 
              as yet received little payment for the volumes it had printed for 
              its sister-company. Scott resolved to wind down the publishing house, 
              but how to do so without revealing his own role was a delicate matter. 
              Scott's social (and quite possibly professional) position would 
              have suffered by the revelation that he was partner in a debt-ridden 
              business and that he had profited in three ways (publishing, printing, 
              and copyright) from the sales of his own books. </p>

            <p>Much to Scott's embarrassment, the publishing house was obliged 
              to turn to Archibald Constable in the hope that he might take over 
              its surviving assets. Constable drove a hard bargain offering &pound;1,300 
              for part of John Ballantyne's unsold stock, on condition that the 
              firm wind up immediately and Scott allow him to purchase a quarter 
              share of the copyright of <i>Rokeby</i> for an extra &pound;700. 
              Constable also agreed to prepare a report into the financial state 
              of both the printing and publishing houses. His conclusion, that 
              they must raise &pound;4,000 immediately to avoid bankruptcy, came 
              as a shock to all three partners. Scott, though, was particularly 
              shaken, as bankruptcy would mean not only revealing his dubious 
              financial dealings to the world but resigning his post as Clerk 
              to the Court of Session (see <a href="law.html">Professional Life</a>). 
              In desperation, he appealed to his patron and clan-chief, the Duke 
              of Buccleuch, who generously agreed to stand guarantor behind an 
              overdraft of &pound;4,000.</p>

              (1825-26)</font></h3>
            <p><img src="graphics/constable.jpg" width="197" height="250" alt="Archibald Constable, photogravure after Sir Henry Raeburn,l903 (Corson B.CAW.1)" align="right" hspace="10">By 
              the mid-1820s, Archibald Constable (portrayed, right) was becoming 
              increasingly nervous about the huge number of bills in circulation 
              bearing his firm's name. These were of two kinds. Firstly, beginning 
              with <i><a href="../works/poetry/marmion.html">Marmion</a></i> (1808), 
              Constable had pioneered an advance system of authorial payment, 
              whereby Scott was paid for a literary work before it was actually 
              written. With Scott requiring ever greater funds for his work on 
              Abbotsford and for the lavish entertaining that his public role 
              entailed, he had taken increasing advantage of this arrangement. 
              By 1825, Scott had outstanding contracts for nine works with Constable, 
              for which he had received advance payment of &pound;10,000. Although 
              Constable himself required to invest immense sums in re-editing 
              the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, fear of losing his most bankable 
              author lured him into dangerous levels of debt. </p>
            <p>Secondly, there were 'accommodation bills' issued not in payment 
              for any work done but for the purpose of raising money on credit. 
              One company or individual would make out a credit note for an amount 
              repayable by a certain date. In return, they required the recipient 
              to make out a counter-bill to the same amount (in order to permit 
              the issuing body to obtain credit for such a sum and to continue 
              trading). These counter-bills were usually held in reserve but were 
              sometimes cashed by the issuing body. If the issuing body could 
              not meet its obligations and the bill proved worthless, the recipient 
              was liable for the entire sum drawn. If, however, the issuing body 
              had cashed or circulated the counter-bill, the recipient was again 
              liable for the amount for which it had been granted. In other words, 
              the recipient would be required to repay the same loan twice. This 
              was a system that tied businesses together in a most precarious 
              manner. Archibald Constable and Co. and James Ballantyne and Co. 
              had each backed the others bills. If either company fell, the other 
              was likely to collapse in its wake. </p>
            <p>Just as Scott's financial demands were undermining the foundations 
              of Archibald Constable and Co., they were placing the Ballantyne 
              Press in increasing jeopardy. Between 1816 and 1822, unknown to 
              the business world, Scott was the sole owner of the Ballantyne Press. 
              Considered a sound concern by the banking houses, the press enabled 
              Scott to raise bills that he would never have been granted as a 
              private individual. He had made extensive use of these credit facilities 
              to finance work on Abbotsford, with the result that when, in 1822, 
              James Ballantyne was re-admitted as co-partner, the business had 
              debts of &pound;27,000. (Ballantyne and Constable too had acquired 
              the dangerous habit of using accommodation bills to fund work on 
              their own property.) Scott acknowledged to Ballantyne both the extent 
              of these debts and his personal responsibility for them. Ballantyne 
              believed that the lands and estate of Abbotsford proved more than 
              adequate security for the firm's liabilities. But in 1825 Scott 
              settled the estate upon his newly married son (though a clause permitted 
              Scott to enjoy life-rent of the property). According to Scots Law 
              as it then stood, Abbotsford was thus put beyond the reach of creditors. 
              James Ballantyne was kept in ignorance of this settlement, and it 
              would come as a rude shock to discover that Abbotsford was not a 
              Printing Office asset (see <a href="ballant.html">The Ballantyne 
              Brothers</a>).</p>
            <p>In 1825 the City of London was swept by a wave of speculation. 
              This soon gave way to panic selling, tumbling prices, and a credit 
              squeeze by the Bank of England. At the height of speculation fever, 
              J.O. Robinson of Constable's English agents, Hurst, Robinson, &amp; 
              Co. had bought over &pound;40,000 in hops in the hope of cornering 
              the market. The market was already glutted, and he was forced to 
              sell at rock-bottom prices. Under pressure to return the &pound;30,000 
              capital Robinson had borrowed, Hurst, Robinson, &amp; Co. were soon 
              having the greatest difficulty in meeting their obligations. Constable 
              &amp; Co. had backed their bills; James Ballantyne &amp; Co. had 
              backed those of Constable &amp; Co. As none of the three firms had 
              a solid security, the collapse of one would bring all three crashing 
              down. Hurst, Robinson &amp; Company were able to meet their most 
              pressing debts for a few weeks by raising short-term loans, but 
              by December 1825 bankruptcy appeared inevitable.</p>

                    of part of a letter from Scott to Adam Ferguson arranging

                    from the height of Scott's second major financial crisis.

            <p>In Edinburgh, frantic efforts were made to drum up credit for Archibald 
              Constable &amp; Co. A clause inserted in his son's marriage settlement 
              enabled Scott to raise a &pound;10,000 mortgage on Abbotsford. This 
              he promptly did with the bulk of the sum going straight into Constable's 
              coffers. On January 5, 1826 an ever more anxious Scott suffered 
              a slight stroke. On January 14, the crisis finally materialized. 
              A bill for &pound;1,000 made out by Robinson in favour of Constable 
              could not be honoured on its due date. Constable had long since 
              cashed and spent the amount. The Bank of Scotland immediately refused 
              any further credit, and Archibald Constable &amp; Co. were forced 
              to stop payment.</p>
            <p>As a private individual and as a partner in James Ballantyne and 
              Co., Scott found himself with debts of &pound;121,000, largely as 
              a result of the duplication of bills under the 'accommodation' system. 
              Scott had four options. He could declare personal bankruptcy, apply 
              for trade bankruptcy (for the majority of his debts had been incurred 
              via his trade partners), apply to friends and relatives for loans, 
              or effect a trust deed. The first would have involved the loss of 
              his library, furniture, and life-rent of Abbotsford and would probably 
              have meant exile. The second would have allowed him to set up in 
              business again in a matter of months by paying his creditors as 
              little as seven shillings in the pound. His sense of honour, however, 
              would not permit such an escape route. Offers of financial assistance, 
              meanwhile, were flooding in - from his son and daughter-in-law, 
              from the Dukes of Buccleuch and Somerset, from Scott's friends, 
              J.S. Morrit, James Skene, and Colin Mackenzie - but Scott was appalled 
              by the thought of charity. It was the final option, the trust deed, 
              that Scott preferred and which his creditors were happy to accept.</p>

              creditors, then, set up a private trust into which Scott would pay 
              his entire revenue from literary sources and thus eventually clear 
              his debts. Scott's close friend, the Edinburgh banker Sir William 
              Forbes (portrayed, right), was instrumental in persuading the Bank 
              of Scotland to accept this arrangement. The Bank had initially argued 
              that Scott's contracts with Constable should be honoured, and that 
              the money from the works in hand should go to the publisher's estate 
              and creditors. They had also felt that Scott's alienation of his 
              creditors' claims on Abbotsford might be open to legal challenge. 
              Forbes also served Scott in paying off the sole creditor who refused 
              to accept the trust option, the London firm of Abud &amp; Sons . 
              The other creditors' clemency stemmed partly from a reluctance to 
              drag down a man regarded as a national treasure, the news of whose 
              ruin had awakened great public sympathy. There was also, however, 
              the hard-headed calculation that should Scott continue writing best-sellers 
              at his current rate (he had written eighteen novels in the previous 
              ten years), they might well see their money back in the not too 
              distant future. They nonetheless took the precaution of insisting 
              Scott take out a life-insurance policy of &pound;20,000 payable 
              to the Trust in the event of his death. </p>
            <p>Scott was permitted to continue to receive the benefits of his 
              official salaries (see <a href="law.html">Professional Life</a>). 
              He voluntarily sold his house at <a href="homes.html">39 Castle 
              Street</a> but was able to preserve his life-rent of Abbotsford. 
              Constable, conversely, was utterly ruined, and his relations with 
              Scott came to an abrupt end. Scott felt that the crash was largely 
              his publisher's responsibility and was particularly bitter about 
              the mortgage on Abbotsford which he had fruitlessly raised to bail 
              him out. Subsequent research, however, has suggested that Cadell 
              was the prime mover in the mortgage episode, and most recent biographers 
              feel that Constable was harshly judged by Scott. Be that as it may, 
              Scott threw in his lot with Cadell, regarding his contracts with 
              Constable as null and void (a point on which the courts eventually 
              agreed). </p>
            <p>He launched himself into a ferocious period of writing (<a href="../works/novels/cavalier.html"><i>Woodstock</i></a>, 
              <a href="../works/novels/canongate.html"> <i>Chronicles of the Canongate</i></a>, 
              <i> <a href="../works/prose/napoleon.html">The Life of Napoleon 
              Buonaparte</a></i>) that had already brought in &pound;40,000 by 
              Christmas 1827. The most lucrative project, however, would be the 
              'Magnum Opus', a readily affordable edition of the Waverley Novels 
              with new introductions and copious notes. Originally floated to 
              Constable, this would be brought out in 48 volumes by Cadell between 
              1829 and 1833. By the time of Scott's death on September 21, 1832 
              the debt had been reduced to &pound;53,000. It would finally be 
              paid off in 1847 by the sale of Scott's remaining copyrights.</p>
