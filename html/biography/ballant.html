                <td width="50%">Scott first met James Ballantyne (1772-1833) when 
                  attending Kelso Grammar School in 1783 (see <a href="education.html">School 
                  and University</a>). The oldest son of a thriving local merchant, 
                  he shared Scott's love of literature, and the two rapidly became 
                  good friends. Like Scott, James went on to study Law at Edinburgh 
                  University, returning to Kelso in 1795 to set up in practice 
                  as a solicitor. The following year he launched the staunchly 
                  pro-Tory newspaper the <i>Kelso Mail</i>, which he both edited 
                  and printed. </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>In 1799, James privately printed the two pamphlets with which
              Scott  began his writing career: <i><a href="../works/poetry/apology/home.html">An Apology for Tales of Terror</a></i> 
              (containing ballads and translations intended for publication in
               <a href="../works/poetry/apology/poets.html#monk">Matthew Gregory
               Lewis</a>'s much-delayed anthology <em>Tales of Wonder</em>)
              and the ballad 'The 
              Eve of St. John' (see <a href="beginning.html">Literary Beginnings</a>).
               Thus began a literary and business partnership that would last
              Scott's 
              lifetime. Scott was so pleased with the typographical excellence
               of these two slim volumes that he offered James the opportunity
              
              of printing the collection of Border ballads that he was in the
               process of gathering. When these eventually appeared as the two
              
              large octavo volumes of <i><a href="../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html">Minstrelsy
               of the Scottish Border</a></i> (1802), there was general astonishment
                in the British book-trade that a small-town printer could produce
               
              work of such quality. Scott immediately urged his friend to relocate
                to Edinburgh, but James wished first to train up the younger
               of 
              his two brothers, Alexander ('Sandy'), to take over the running
                of the <i>Kelso Mail</i>. Sandy, father of the Victorian children's
                 writer, R.M. Ballantyne, would eventually buy James's entire
                interest 
              in the <i>Kelso Mail</i> in 1806.</p>

            <p>Scott finally persuaded James to move to Edinburgh in 1803, loaning 
              him &pound;500 to increase the liquid capital of his business. James 
              initially set up his presses in two small rooms in Holyrood House, 
              but thriving business soon led him to seek larger premises. Orders 
              flooded in from Edinburgh publishers and Scott was instrumental 
              in securing for Ballantyne the right to print Session papers (see 
              <a href="law.html">Professional Life</a>). James first moved to 
              Foulis Close in the Canongate then, in 1805, to Paul's Work, situated 
              between the Canongate and Leith Wynd.</p>

            <p>In that same year, though, the unprecedented success of <i><a href="../works/poetry/minstrel.html">The 
              Lay of the Last Minstrel</a></i><a href="../works/poetry/minstrel.html">,</a> 
              printed by Ballantyne for Archibald Constable, severely strained 
              the small firm's financial resources. Printing jobs for other publishers 
              were delayed for want of capital to purchase materials (paper, inks, 
              type-faces, extra presses). Customers habitually demanded generous 
              credit before placing orders so money was slow coming in. However 
              prosperous the business appeared, Ballantyne sometimes lacked the 
              ready funds to pay his employees' wages. He thus requested a further 
              loan from Scott. Scott had recently been left &pound;5,000 on the 
              death of his uncle, Robert Scott, and grasped the opportunity to 
              obtain a share in a business with excellent long-term prospects. 
              He offered to inject further capital on condition of being made 
              a partner. An agreement was signed on May 26, 1805, whereby Scott 
              advanced a further &pound;1,500 (his original &pound;500 loan being 
              converted into share capital) and became owner of a third of the 
              company's stock. The arrangement was kept a close secret from all 
              but Scott's friend Will Erskine. </p>

              the aid of Scott's capital the press continued to prosper. Scott 
              threw himself into a great deal of editorial work on scholarly and 
              antiquarian volumes which he insisted must be printed by James Ballantyne 
              and Co. Scott's achievements as an editor are perhaps the most overlooked 
              aspect of his literary career. Most significant in these years was 
              the eighteen-volume set of the works of John Dryden (portrayed, 
              left) who many critics have seen as Scott's role model as a professional 
              writer. Other works edited or part-edited by Scott include <i>Memoirs 
              of Captain George Carleton</i>, <i>Memoirs of Robert Carey</i>, 
              <i>State Papers and Letters of Sir Ralph Sadler</i>, and Joseph 
              Strutt's <i>Queenhoo-Hall</i> (see <a href="novel.html">Scott the 
              Novelis</a>t). These all brought considerable profits to Ballantyne 
              and Co. (and, by extension to Scott himself) but little for the 
              publishers involved.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="../graphics/constable.jpg" width="209" height="250" align="right" alt="Archibald Constable, engraved by James Faed after Sir Henry Raeburn, 1873 (Corson F.1.b.CON.CON.1)">The 
              press's greatest success in these years, however, was Scott's second 
              narrative poem <a href="../works/poetry/marmion.html"><i>Marmion</i></a> 
              (1808) which proved even more popular than <i>The Lay of the Last 
              Minstrel</i>. <i>Marmion</i> was printed by Ballantyne for the publisher 
              Archibald Constable (portrayed, right) but Scott was now keen to 
              distance himself from Constable. He detested the Whig politics of 
              Constable's <i>Edinburgh Review</i> and had been particularly incensed 
              by Francis Jeffrey's condemnation of British intervention in the 
              Peninsular War which had appeared on its pages. He had also been 
              hurt by Jeffrey's high-handed critique of <i>Marmion</i>. Keen to 
              partake of the huge profits with which he was currently lining Constable's 
              pockets, Scott decided to set up a rival publishing house. Looking 
              around for a capable manager, his choice fell on the middle Ballantyne 
              brother, John.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="../graphics/JoBal.jpg" width="197" height="280" align="left" hspace="10" alt="John Ballantyne, photogravure after unknown artist, 1903 (Corson B.CAW.1)">On 
              the face of it, John Ballantyne (1774-1821), with his hard-won reputation 
              as the black sheep of the family, was a perverse choice. After serving 
              an apprenticeship at a London banking house, he had been taken on 
              as a partner in his father's business in Kelso. In 1797, however, 
              the two men quarreled bitterly over John's choice of bride, and 
              John set up a rival store. Although it initially prospered, mismanagement, 
              womanizing and all-round high living brought John near ruin by 1806. 
              With difficulty, James dissuaded him from emigrating to the West 
              Indies and offered him a clerical post in his printing office, provided 
              that he mend his ways and make up with his now estranged wife. In 
              this new capacity John impressed Scott with his inventive approach 
              to book-keeping. Rapidly tiring of office drudgery, he leapt at 
              the chance to head the publishing firm which was founded in 1809. 
              Based in Hanover Street, it would trade under the name of John Ballantyne 
              and Co. Scott acquired a half-share in the business (again a closely 
              guarded secret), and James and John were allotted a quarter share 
              each. Profits were to be divided in the same proportion and matters 
              of policy to be decided jointly. Later in 1809 Scott renegotiated 
              his position with James Ballantyne's printing company, obtaining 
              a half-share in the business through a new injection of capital.</p>
            <p>John Ballantyne and Co.'s first publication, Scott's <a href="../works/poetry/lady.html"><i>The 
              Lady of the Lake</i></a> appeared in 1810. The huge profits led 
              the three partners into a wildly optimistic estimate of their future 
              prospects. The selection of future titles for publication fell to 
              Scott himself, who launched a series of commercially disastrous 
              titles. Profits from <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> were not ploughed 
              back into the business, and debts mounted rapidly. It was at this 
              juncture that Scott decided to throw further capital into the purchase 
              of Cartley Hole Farm, soon to be renamed <a href="homes.html">Abbotsford</a>. 
              Half of this sum was raised by John Ballantyne on the security of 
              the as yet unwritten <i><a href="../works/poetry/rokeby.html">Rokeby</a></i>, 
              the poem to which Scott was looking both to cover his building expenses 
              and to bale out the publishing house.</p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/buccleuch.jpg" width="196" height="250" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Charles, 4th Duke of Buccleuch, photogravure after chalk drawing by Sir David Wilkie, 1903 (Corson B.CAW.1)">By 
              spring 1813, a series of banking crises had brought the war-ravaged 
              economy to a crisis. John Ballantyne and Co. had been forced to 
              sell some of the copyrights of Scott's works (their most valuable 
              assets) to raise ready capital. <i>Rokeby</i>, although a great 
              success by any other poet's standards, fell far short of being the 
              panacea to all the company's ills. The Ballantynes reluctantly approached 
              Archibald Constable who offered &pound;1,300 for part of their unsold 
              stock, on condition that the firm wind up immediately and Scott 
              allow him to purchase a quarter share of the copyright of <i>Rokeby</i> 
              for an extra &pound;700. Constable also agreed to prepare a report 
              into the financial state of both the printing and publishing companies, 
              concluding that they must raise &pound;4,000 immediately to avoid 
              bankruptcy. Bankruptcy would have made public the secret arrangement 
              whereby Scott profited from the printing, publishing, and royalties 
              of every book he wrote. He would have been forced to resign as Clerk 
              to the Court of Session and thus lose his regular income. In desperation, 
              Scott turned to his patron, the Duke of Buccleuch (portrayed, above 
              right), who agreed to stand guarantor behind a redeemable annuity 
              for a sum of &pound;4,000 (see <a href="finance.html">Financial 
              Hardship</a>). </p>
            <p>Constable was to publish Scott next narrative poem <a href="../works/poetry/lord.html"><i>The 
              Lord of the Isles</i></a> and the first three Waverley Novels (<i><a href="../works/novels/waverley.html">Waverley</a></i>, 
              <i><a href="../works/novels/mannering.html">Guy Mannering</a></i>, 
              and <i><a href="../works/novels/antiquary.html">The Antiquary</a></i>). 
              After publishing the First Series of <i>Tales of My Landlord</i> 
              (<a href="../works/novels/dwarf.html"><i>The Black Dwarf </i></a>and 
              <a href="../works/novels/mortality.html"><i>Old Mortality</i></a>) 
              with William Blackwood, Scott returned to Constable for <a href="../works/novels/robroy.html"><i>Rob 
              Roy</i></a> (1817), eventually persuading him to buy all of John 
              Ballantyne and Co.'s unsold stock. The contract for each new novel 
              stipulated that that the printing be undertaken by James Ballantyne 
              and Co. and that Constable had the right only to manage and sell 
              an agreed number of copies. In effect, then, Scott and James Ballantyne 
              controlled production. </p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/press.jpg" width="250" height="197" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Old wooden press at Paul's Work, photogravure, 1909 (Corson F.4.b.BAL.1)"> 
              James's role extended far beyond that of business partner or printer. 
              His and Scott's was a unique literary relationship. Scott consulted 
              James on the artistic merit and likely commercial success of each 
              work. James read Scott's proofs, acting as editor rather than mere 
              proof-reader. He would point out inconsistencies in detail and gaps 
              in the text, insert names of speakers in dialogue, correct punctuation 
              and grammatical errors, and remove close verbal repetitions. The 
              annotated proofs were then sent back to Scott who made further alterations. 
              James made further editorial interventions on post-authorial proofs, 
              making changes that were probably never inspected by Scott. (Portrayed, 
              above left, is a wooden press used in printing the Waverley Novels 
              at the Ballantyne Press.)</p>
            <p>In autumn 1815 James proposed marriage to Christina Hogarth. Her 
              father would only consent if James could prove himself free from 
              debt. Scott agreed to discharge James from his liabilities for the 
              publishing house's debts on condition that Scott assume ownership 
              of James Ballantyne and Co., retaining James as a salaried manager. 
              The irrepressible John, meanwhile, had reinvented himself as a successful 
              auctioneer in his publishing house's old premises. He had even succeeded 
              in selling off a good deal of his own stock by putting it in other 
              people's sale catalogues. Esteeming his ability to drive a hard 
              bargain and his skill in confidential bill discounting, money-changing, 
              loan raising, and double accountancy, Scott continued to employ 
              him as his literary agent.</p>

(Click <a href="http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/aboutus/morayhouse/stjohnsstreet/index.html">here</a> for a page, with photograph, on the history of St. John Street, published by <a href="http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/aboutus/morayhouse/">Moray House School of Education</a>.) Nonetheless 
                  his financial circumstances remained straitened. He was constantly 
                  under pressure to renew or pay back loans contracted in the 
                  early days of Ballantyne Press. He had been forced to borrow 
                  heavily in order to keep his capital in the enterprise on a 
                  par with Scott's, and later in order to invest in John Ballantyne 
                  and Co.</td>

            <p>James's financial worries eased when, in 1817, he purchased the 
              <i>Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i> along with his brother-in-law George 
              Hogarth. James assumed editorship and employed John as a musical 
              and drama critic, in which capacity he soon gained a considerable 
              reputation. Circulation rapidly expanded, and Hogarth ensured that 
              profits were ploughed back into the business. By now, however, John's 
              decades of hard living were catching up with him. After several 
              years of ill health, he died on June 16, 1821 of pulmonary consumption. 
              Shortly before his death, Scott had offered to write biographical 
              introductions for a project that John had long cherished: a series 
              of reprints of popular novels and romances at readily affordable 
              prices. Scott saw through the publication of 'Ballantyne's Novelists' 
              Library' in memory of his dead friend.</p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/son.jpg" width="180" height="250" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Sir Walter Scott, Second Baronet, photogravure after Sir William Allan, 1903 (Corson B.CAW.1)" >Scott 
              now promoted James Ballantyne from manager of the printing business 
              to personal agent and partner, while Sandy Ballantyne took over 
              the editorship of the <i>Weekly Journal</i>. The Ballantyne Press 
              was massively in demand, printing works for publishing houses both 
              north and south of the Border, and cornering the market for printing 
              legal stationary and official documents thanks to Scott's influence. 
              But money that should have gone on repaying loans had gone instead 
              to pay for work on Abbotsford. Ballantyne was quite aware that Scott 
              had run up vast debts in the company's name but assumed that the 
              land and buildings of Abbotsford were the firm's security. Unknown 
              to James, though, Scott settled the whole estate on his newly married 
              son, Walter (portrayed, above left) in 1825, thus putting it beyond 
              the reach of creditors. </p>
            <p>Thus in the financial crisis of 1826, when the failure of Hurst, 
              Robinson &amp; Company brought in its wake that of Archibald Constable 
              and the Ballantyne Press (see <a href="finance.html">Financial Hardship</a>). 
              James found himself liable for half of the company's debts. He was 
              forced to sell his new home and all the family valuables but permitted 
              to continue living at St. John Street. Under the surveillance of 
              the trust appointed to administer Scott's earnings, James was permitted 
              to stay on as manager of the printing business. A salary of &pound;400 
              p.a. with no benefits meant a steep decline in his standard of living. 
              Sandy Ballantyne, who had invested all his own spare capital in 
              the Ballantyne Press, was permitted to resume management of the<i> 
              Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i>.</p>
            <p>The fortunes of the surviving Ballantyne brothers gradually revived. 
              Many Edinburgh businessmen felt that James bore little guilt in 
              the collapse of his firm, pointing instead to Scott's incessant 
              demand for funds. Soon, Alexander Cowan, chairman of Scott's trustees, 
              was sufficiently confident to buy the printing house as a going 
              concern for &pound;10,000 in Ballantyne's name. James contracted 
              to repay him the capital sum with interest over the coming years. 
              Shortly afterwards Sandy was admitted into partnership. The firm 
              gradually improved its turnover, and the loan was repaid by the 
              end of 1832. </p>

                <td>Although Scott had no official business relationship with 
                  James Ballantyne &amp; Co. after 1826, loyalty led him to insist 
                  that his new publisher Robert Cadell (portrayed, right) continue 
                  to use the press. It appears that in the final years of Scott's 
                  life, relations with James began to cool. Scott was hurt by 
                  his adverse criticism of <a href="../works/novels/geierstein.html"><i>Anne 
                  of Geierstein</i></a> and <a href="../works/novels/robert.html"><i>Count 
                  Robert of Paris</i></a> and appalled by his conversion to Whig 
                  politics and evangelical religion. Cadell, who had little time 
                  for the Ballantynes and thought their typographical prowess 
                  overrated, sought to prise them further apart by using James 
                  to convey his own reservations about Scott's later works. </td>

            <p>James, who had been devastated by the loss of his wife in 1829, 
              died shortly after Scott on January 26, 1833. His son, John Alexander 
              Ballantyne, took over management of the Ballantyne Press with the 
              help of John Hughes (who had risen up from the post of compositor). 
              Business continued to thrive for a few years but by mid-century 
              they were suffering serious competition from other steam presses. 
              In Edinburgh, Blackwood's had emerged as serious rivals, and the 
              publishing world was increasingly centred on London. Their Edinburgh 
              printing works finally closed in 1916. <br>
