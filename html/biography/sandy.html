              1773 the infant Scott was sent to Sandyknowe Farm in the hope that 
              fresh air and exercise would mend his delicate health. Located 30 
              miles southeast of Edinburgh in Roxburghshire, Sandyknowe belonged 
              to Walter Scott's grandparents Robert and Barbara Scott. Scott's 
              constant companion was his Aunt Janet (Jenny) who would read to 
              him on days when he was unable to venture outside due to his illness. 
              A particular favourite was Allan Ramsay's <i>Tea-Table Miscellany</i>, 
              and Scott's lifelong love of ballads had its origins in his Aunt's 
              recitations from this collection. His grandmother too would entertain 
              him with tales of Border warfare between the Scots and the English 
              and stories of his own family's struggles during the civil and religious 
              turmoil of 17th- and 18th-century Scotland.</p>
            <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
              <tr>
                <td width="54%">Those featured in his grandmother's stories included 
                  Scott's great-great-great grandfather William who had been knighted 
                  by James I and VI only to be later fined by Cromwell for his 
                  loyalty to Charles I. Other family legends concerned Scott's 
                  great-grandfather, Walter, or 'Beardie', who was so loyal to 
                  the Stuart dynasty that after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 
                  he vowed never to cut his beard until a Stuart king was once 
                  again on the throne. His participation in the 1715 uprising 
                  cost him his fortune and very nearly his life.</td>

            <p>Aunt Jenny not only told Scott stories but also taught him how 
              to read. Although he was at first reluctant, his Aunt's persistence 
              paid off, and Scott soon became a very competent and enthusiastic 
              reader. In January 1775 his grandfather died, and Scott returned 
              to Edinburgh. His stay in the Borders had improved his health, and 
              he was now able to walk with the aid of a small staff. </p>

                <td width="55%">Nonetheless, in the summer of 1775 he was sent,
                   accompanied by Aunt Jenny, to Bath, where it was hoped that
                  
                  the waters might aid his lameness. It was here that an unknown
                   artist painted a watercolour profile of the young Scott, 
                  commonly known as the '<a href="../portraits/paintings/bath.html">Bath
                  Miniature</a>' (see left for an engraving
                   by <a href="../portraits/engravers/horsburgh.html">John Horsburgh</a>). He spent a year in the spa town, returning
                  
                  to Edinburgh the following summer with a marked English accent.</td>

            <p align="left">Although Scott had continued to grow stronger in 
              Bath, there had been no improvement in his leg. In winter 1776, 
              then, he was again consigned to Sandyknowe, where his grandmother 
              was now running the farm with the help of her son Thomas. Scott 
              spent the long winter months reading the books he found on the farm, 
              growing particularly fond of Josephus's <i>Wars of the Jews</i>. 
              A further unsuccessful water cure was attempted at Prestonpans in 
              summer 1777 until, after a final winter at Sandyknowe, his father 
              was persuaded that Scott's lameness was irremediable but his health 
              sufficiently strong to permit him to begin <a href="education.html">school</a> 
              in Edinburgh. In addition to building his strength, Scott's residence 
              at Sandyknowe had provided him with a firm grounding in storytelling 
              and ancient oral Border traditions, which he would later employ 
              in his fiction.<br>
