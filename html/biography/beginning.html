            <h2><font color="#003366"><a name="top"></a>Literary Beginnings</font></h2>
            <p>Scott's first attempts at literary composition were made during 
              his years at the Royal High School of Edinburgh with the encouragement 
              of the Rector, Alexander Adam. His school years saw Scott discover 
              many lasting literary influences: Shakespeare, Spenser, Ariosto, 
              Percy's <i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i> and the great 
              eighteenth-century novel tradition of Richardson, Fielding, Smollett 
              and Mackenzie (see <a href="education.html">School and University</a>). 
              After leaving school, the wages that Scott earned as apprentice 
              in his father's office gave him the means to expand his literary 
              education (see <a href="law.html">Professional Life</a>). He attended 
              performances at the theatre in Old Playhouse Close and was able 
              to borrow more extensively from James Sibbald's circulating library. 
              He took Italian classes in order to appreciate Ariosto (below left) 
              and Tasso in the original, going on to read Dante, Boccaccio, and 
              Pulci. He worked on his French too, perusing the great French historical 
              chroniclers and the novels of La Calpren&egrave;de, Scudery, and 
              Lesage (below centre). He even mastered sufficient Spanish to read 
              <i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i>, Cervantes (below right), and Gin&eacute;s 
              P&eacute;rez de Hita's <i>Guerras civiles de Granada</i>, generally 
              regarded as the first Spanish historical novel. </p>

            <p>P&eacute;rez de Hita, who interspersed his narrative with Moorish 
              border ballads, inspired Scott's first attempt at a long narrative 
              poem <i>The Conquest of Grenada</i>. Scott soon, however, consigned 
              the manuscript to the fire. Over two decades later, however, the 
              <i>Guerras civiles de Granada </i>would provide the creative spark 
              for Scott's poem <i><a href="../works/poetry/donroderick.html">The 
              Vision of Don Roderick</a></i> (1811). </p>
            <p>It was also during his apprenticeship that Scott made his first 
              acquaintances in the literary world. A friend from his University 
              days, Adam Ferguson, was the son of the great Enlightenment thinker 
              Professor Adam Ferguson. Ferguson's home at Sciennes Hill House 
              was a meeting place for Edinburgh's literati. Here Scott met the 
              blind poet Thomas Blacklock who permitted him to borrow at leisure 
              from his library and introduced him to the James Macpherson's <i>Poems 
              of Ossian</i>. </p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/burns.jpg" width="210" height="250" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Robert Burns, engraved by Henry Robinson after Alexander Naysmith, 1876 (Corson P.2023)">In 
              the winter of 1786-87, Ferguson's salon was the scene of the only 
              encounter between Scott and Robert Burns. Scott was impressed by 
              the plainness of Burns's manners and the independence of his judgment 
              but unconvinced by the humility with which he praised poets that 
              were clearly his inferiors. The fifteen-year-old Scott only once 
              succeeded in attracting Burns's attention. Burns was moved by a 
              sentimental print illustrating a poem entitled 'The Justice of the 
              Peace'. When he asked who had written the original poem, only Scott 
              was able to tell him it was by John Langhorne. For this, Scott received 
              a look and word of thanks that he would always remember.</p>
            <p>In the second year of Scott's apprenticeship, a serious illness 
              led to a lengthy convalescence which was partly spent at his uncle 
              Robert Scott's villa at Kelso. Here Scott wrote his first love poetry 
              to 'Jessie', daughter of a small tradesman, whom he addressed with 
              conventional gallantry as the 'Flower of Kelso' and 'Pride of Teviotdale'. 
              Although the anxious Scott destroyed all of Jessie's correspondence 
              with him, his sweetheart preserved his letters and poems and later 
              confided the details of their affair to an anonymous biographer. 
              These were edited and published by Davidson Cook in 1932 as <i>New 
              Love Poems: Discovered in the Narrative of an Unknown Love Episode 
              with Jessie --- of Kelso</i> (see <a href="bibliography.html">Bibliography</a>).</p>
            <p>During his second spell at University (1789-92) Scott formed a 
              Poetry Society and joined the Literary Society where he gave papers 
              sparked by his new-found interest in Old Norse and Icelandic literature 
              and mythology, a passion which would later be channeled into such 
              works as <a href="../works/poetry/harold.html"><i>Harold the Dauntless</i></a> 
              (1817) and <i><a href="../works/novels/pirate.html">The Pirate</a></i> 
              (1821). As Librarian (and subsequently Secretary and Treasurer) 
              of the Speculative Society, he further enhanced his reputation for 
              antiquarian erudition, impressing his fellow-members with his knowledge 
              of medieval culture and ballad-lore.</p>
            <p>During the first years of Scott's practice as an Advocate, he was 
              employed primarily on the Jedburgh circuit and at other Border courts 
              (see <a href="law.html">Professional Life</a>). This provided ample 
              opportunity to indulge the love of ballads originally kindled during 
              his childhood stay at <a href="sandy.html">Sandyknowe</a>. Beginning 
              in 1792, Scott made annual ballad-collecting trips to Liddesdale 
              and its environs, aided by fellow enthusiasts such as Robert Shortreed 
              and William Elliott. Initiated with no specific end in view, the 
              fruits of Scott's 'raids' would eventually comprise his <a href="../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html"><i>Minstrelsy 
              of the Scottish Border</i></a>.</p>

            <p>Together with his ballad-collecting, Scott made the discovery in 
              the early 1790s of the pre-Romantic <i>Sturm und Drang</i> school 
              of German poets and dramatists. Like many of his European contemporaries, 
              Scott was excited by their rejection of neo-classical conventions, 
              stress on subjectivity and emotional intensity, love of nature, 
              and depiction of man in conflict with contemporary society. He began 
              studying German in order to read the movement's leading writers, 
              Goethe, Schiller, Klopstock, and B&uuml;rger.</p>

                  to capture something of his wild, highly-charged imagery in 
                  his own English versions. A privately circulated translation 
                  of B&uuml;rger's 'Lenore' ('William and Helen') created a stir 
                  in Edinburgh's literary circles. Encouraged, Scott went on to 
                  render 'Der Wilde J&auml;ger' into English as 'The Chase'. Published 
                  together with 'William and Helen' by Manners and Miller in 1796, 
                  this was to be Scott's first publication.</td>

			<p>Scott acquired further works of modern German literature through 
              the offices of Harriet, the German wife of his relative Scott of
			   Harden who also provided linguistic assistance. Scott's approach 
              to translation was, by modern standards, somewhat cavalier, and
			   his shaky grasp of German grammar led to many inaccuracies. Over 
              the next few years he produced translations of Maier's <i>Fust
              von  Stromberg</i>, Iffland's <i>Die M&uuml;ndel</i> (<i>The Wards</i>),
               Schiller's <i>Die Verschw&ouml;rung des Fiesco zu Genua</i> (<i>Conspiracy
                of Fiesco</i>), Steinsberg's adaptation of Von Babo's <i>Otto
                von  Wittelsbach</i>, and <a href="../works/poetry/apology/poets.html#goethe">Goethe</a>'s <i>Goetz von Berlichingen</i>.
                It  was the latter which most enthused Scott. He saw parallels
                between 
              its robber barons and the Border reivers of his beloved ballads
                 and first glimpsed how history could be made vividly present
                to 
              a modern readership.</p>

                  <p>In spring 1798 Scott's friend Will Erskine made the acquaintance 
                    in London of <a href="../works/poetry/apology/poets.html#monk">Matthew
                    Gregory Lewis</a>, author of the hugely popular 
                    Gothic novel <i>The Monk</i>. Lewis was then collecting material 
                    for a poetic miscellany to be entitled <i>Tales of Terror</i>. 
                    Erskine showed him Scott's translations from B&uuml;rger, 
                    and Lewis, greatly impressed, requested that Scott contribute 
                    to his anthology. Scott agreed to submit some Scots ballads 
                    that he had collected but, while selecting suitable material, 
                    began work on his first original ballads, all based on Scottish 
                    supernatural lore: 'The Fire-King', 'Glenfinlas, or Lord Ronald's 
                    Coronach', 'The Eve of St. John', and the unfinished 'The 
                    Gray Brother' (later published in vol. III of the <i>Minstrelsy 
                    of the Scottish Border</i>).</p>

			<p>Lewis also helped Scott find a London publisher, J. Bell, for his 
              version of <i>Goetz von Berlichingen</i>. While the volume was being 
              typeset, a gust of wind blew some of the manuscript out of a window, 
              and one page was lost. Lewis promptly secured a copy of the original 
              and re-translated the missing passage. <i>Goetz </i>appeared on 
              March 14, 1799, but a further mishap saw the translation attributed 
              to William Scott. Fortunately, although Scott's <i>Goetz</i> was 
              only a modest commercial success, enough copies were sold to justify 
              a second printing with the translator's name corrected.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, the publication of Lewis's miscellany was much delayed. 
              In summer or autumn 1799, an impatient Scott had twelve copies
			  of  a mini-anthology, <i><a href="../works/poetry/apology/home.html">An
			  Apology for Tales of Terror</a></i>, privately 
              printed in Kelso by his old school-friend <a href="ballant.html">James
               Ballantyne</a>. Along with poems by Lewis, <a href="../works/poetry/apology/poets.html#southey">Robert
               Southey</a>,
               and  <a href="../works/poetry/apology/poets.html#aikin">John
               Aikin</a>, this included Scott's revised versions of
               'William and 
              Helen' and 'The Chase', together with 'The Erl-King', a ballad
               he had translated from Goethe. Shortly afterwards, a private printing
               of 'The Eve
               of St. 
              John' appeared. These two slim pamphlets mark the beginnings of
                Scott's collaboration with the Ballantyne Press which would go
               on 
              to print all of Scott's major works. (For more information on Scott's
               relations with M. G. Lewis and his early interest in German literature,
               see Douglass H. Thomson's online <a href="../works/poetry/apology/home.html">critical
               edition</a> of <em>An Apology
               for Tales of Terror</em>).</p>
			<p>Lewis's miscellany was finally published on November 27, 1800, 
              under the amended title <i>Tales of Wonder</i>. Besides a reprint
              of 'The Chase' (renamed as 'The Wild Huntsman'),
                it contained another Goethe translation 'Frederick and Alice'
			  and three original Scott compositions, 'The Fire King', 'Glenfinlas',
                and 'The Eve of St. John'. By now, however, Scott was deeply
			  engaged in compiling his <a href="../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html"><i>Minstrelsy
			   of the Scottish Border</i></a>, the work that would mark his
                true entry into the literary world (see <a href="poet.html">Scott
