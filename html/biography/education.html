              his return from <a href="sandy.html">Sandyknowe</a>, Scott was privately 
              educated in preparation for the High School of Edinburgh (now the 
              Royal High School), which he entered in October 1779. The School 
              had just moved into its new building on Infirmary Street (portrayed 
              left), now the seat of Edinburgh University's Department of Archaeology. 
              Scott initially felt at something of a disadvantage, for although 
              he was a year older than most of his classmates, his knowledge of 
              Latin, the staple of the school's curriculum, was markedly inferior. 
              Soon, however, he had bridged the gap and became a competent if 
              never brilliant scholar. He was popular with his schoolfellows who 
              admired his refusal to let his lameness prevent him from participating 
              in their boisterous playground games. The young Scott was already 
              a tireless walker, endlessly exploring the streets of the Old Town 
              and familiarizing himself with the terrain that was to feature in 
              <i><a href="../works/novels/midlothian.html">The Heart of Midlothian</a></i> 
              and <i><a href="../works/novels/redgaun.html">Redgauntlet</a></i>.              </p>

                <td width="54%">Scott thought his first-year tutor Luke Fraser 
                  something of a pedant. He took much greater pleasure in learning 
                  when in 1780 he entered the class of the rector, Dr Alexander 
                  Adam (1741-1809). Adam, one of the most innovative educators 
                  of his age, sought to instill in his pupils not only a grasp 
                  of grammar but a sensitivity to literary language. With Adam's 
                  encouragement, the young Scott translated Horace and Virgil 
                  into English verse and made his first attempts at original composition.</td>

            <p>His education was not confined to the school day. Together with 
              chivalric romances and the poems of Spenser, Ariosto, and Boiardo, 
              Scott was already a voracious reader of history and books of travel. 
              His father had also engaged a private tutor, James Mitchell, to 
              teach him arithmetic and writing (not part of the High School's 
              curriculum). Mitchell, a fiery defender of the Kirk, found time 
              to verse Scott in church history and in the travails of the Covenanters, 
              lessons which would eventually bear fruit in <a href="../works/novels/mortality.html"><i>Old 
              Mortality</i></a>.</p>

                  had put on several inches -- as an adult he was over six feet 
                  tall -- and his family feared that he was outgrowing his strength. 
                  Before sending him to college, they therefore decided that he 
                  should spend half-a-year with his Aunt Jenny in Kelso building 
                  up his constitution. He was to keep up his Latin while at Kelso 
                  by attending the local Grammar School, picturesquely set in 
                  the shadow of the ruined abbey (left). </td>

            <p><img src="../graphics/percy.jpg" width="166" height="250" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Walter Scott's introduction to Percy's Reliques, by Winifred Matthews, 1914 (Corson P.3448)">Here 
              he made one of the most significant friendships of his life. Among 
              his classmates was the son of a local shop-keeper, <a href="ballant.html">James 
              Ballantyne</a>, Scott's future business-partner and printer of his 
              major works. It was also at Kelso, which was equipped with well-stocked 
              circulating and subscription libraries, that Scott discovered the 
              eighteenth-century novel, delighting in the works of Richardson, 
              Fielding, Smollett and Mackenzie. His most pleasurable encounter, 
              however, was with Bishop Percy's great ballad-collection <i>Reliques 
              of Ancient English Poetry</i>. For Scott, it was a revelation that 
              a distinguished scholar could share his enthusiasm for popular poetry 
              and consider it a subject for serious research. The <i>Reliques</i> 
              would later provide the model for Scott's first important publication 
              <a href="../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html"> <i>The Minstrelsy of 
              the Scottish Border</i></a>.</p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/university.jpg" width="250" height="137" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Edinburgh College at the End of the Eighteenth Century, unknown artist (Q* 11.15)">In 
              November 1783, Scott was called home to study classics at Edinburgh 
              University. At only twelve years old, he was a year or so younger 
              than most of his classmates. An initial sense of inferiority was 
              heightened by his ignorance of Greek. With overpopulated lecture-rooms, 
              no tutorials, and uninspiring teaching, there was little hope of 
              him catching up with his peers. At the end of his first session, 
              Scott scandalized his Greek lecturer, Professor Dalzell, by handing 
              in an essay arguing that Ariosto was a superior poet to Homer. He 
              nonetheless became popular with his fellow students, making a number 
              of acquaintances which would prove influential in his professional 
              life as a lawyer, including William Rae, future Lord Advocate, and 
              Archibald Campbell, later judge of the Court of Session. Scott initially 
              spent two years at the College, interrupted by an illness necessitating 
              a further stay at Kelso. Then in March 1786, he began his apprenticeship 
              to the profession of Writer to the Signet in his father's office 
              (see <a href="law.html">Professional Life</a>). </p>
            <p align="left"><img src="../graphics/dugald.jpg" width="204" height="250" align="right" alt="Dugald Stewart, engraved by Samuel Freeman after Sir Henry Raeburn, 1864 (O.S. .9(41)092 Cha.)" hspace="10">When 
              it was subsequently decided that Scott should aim for the Bar rather 
              than follow his father's career, he resumed his university studies. 
              Before taking up the formal study of Law, he attended classes in 
              Moral Philosophy and Universal History in 1789-90. The former was 
              taught by the charismatic Dugald Stewart (1753-1828) who combined 
              the Scottish 'Common Sense' tradition with elements of empiricism. 
              Believing that the true object of moral philosophy was the study 
              of man in society, Stewart argued that human welfare could be advanced 
              by following universal ideals of truth and virtue. Scott was skeptical 
              of Stewart's belief that irrational institutions and customs could 
              be clinically eliminated, maintaining that these developed in an 
              organic fashion and could not be uprooted without inflicting moral 
              and emotional damage. Nonetheless, Stewart's stress on man as a 
              social being, his view of society as a constantly evolving mechanism, 
              and his faith in universal, trans-historical values would all play 
              their part in the development of Scott's own philosophy of history.</p>

                <td width="60%">Equally significant were Alexander Fraser Tytler's lectures
                  on Universal History. Tytler (1747-1813) impressed Scott with
                  his distrust of grandiose, universal schemes of history and
                  his horror of generalizations. An empiricist in the tradition
                  of Hume, he emphasized the role of institutions, heredity,
                  and environment as the shaping forces of history. Through Stewart
                  and Tytler, then, Scott came into contact with Enlightenment
                  approaches to history and sociology. In his fiction, these
                  would be brought to bear on the oral, folk traditions that
                he had absorbed at Sandyknowe and Kelso. </td>
