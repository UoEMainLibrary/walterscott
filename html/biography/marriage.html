            <p><img src="../graphics/williamina.jpg" width="243" height="280" align="right" alt="Lady Forbes, engraved by C.H. Jeens, 1873 (Corson F.1.b.FORJ.SHA)">Williamina 
              Belsches (1776-1810) was the only child of Sir John Belsches Wishart, 
              a wealthy Advocate who owned an estate at Fettercairn in Kincardineshire, 
              and Lady Jane Belsches, the daughter of the Earl of Leven and Melville. 
              Scott first noticed her while attending Greyfriars' Church in Edinburgh 
              in 1790, and began courting her even though she was barely fourteen 
              years old and of markedly higher social standing. By 1795 Scott 
              had enough money to marry but scarcely enough to support a lady 
              of Williamina's rank. He confided in his close friend William Clerk, 
              a former classmate at <a href="education.html">Edinburgh University</a>, 
              whose advice was to write to Williamina and boldly declare his love. 
              Both Scott's letter and Williamina's response have been lost. Scott 
              is known to have been overjoyed by Williamina's reply. It seems 
              likely, though, that she merely did not forbid him to hope and insisted 
              that they remain circumspect. In all events, their relationship 
              remained unchanged.</p>
            <p>In spring 1796 Scott went on a trip north which included a visit 
              to Williamina's parents who, much to his delight, invited him to 
              prolong his stay. However, unbeknown to Scott, Williamina had made 
              the acquaintance of William Forbes of Pitsligo, heir of a banking 
              family, during the previous winter. Their intimacy grew when Forbes 
              stayed as a guest at Fettercairn in summer 1796, and on 12 October 
              their engagement was announced. Scott felt humiliated and betrayed, 
              and for many years believed that he had been led on and cruelly 
              jilted. Slowly, Scott's anger receded and he half-realised that 
              Williamina had not intended to hurt him. His pain nonetheless remained 
              profound, and his subsequent correspondence avoids all mention of 
              her name. Scott later wrote of marriage:</p>
            <p>'Scarce one person out of twenty marries his first love, and scarce 
              one out of twenty of the remainder has cause to rejoice at having 
              done so. What we love in these early days is generally rather a 
              fanciful creation of our own than a reality. We build statues of 
              snow and weep when they melt.' (Letter to G.H. Gordon, 12 June 1820)</p>
            <p>Many critics have seen echoes of Scott's unsuccessful courtship 
              of Williamina in the frustrated passions portrayed in his literary 
              works, particularly those of Wilfred Wycliffe for Matilda Rokeby 
              (<i><a href="../works/poetry/rokeby.html">Rokeby</a></i>), of the 
              Master of Ravenswood for Lucy Ashton (<i><a href="../works/novels/lammermoor.html">The 
              Bride of Lammermoor</a></i>), and of Darsie Latimer for 'Greenmantle' 
              (<i><a href="../works/novels/redgaun.html">Redgauntlet</a></i>).</p>
            <p> In September 1797, on the invitation of his old college friend 
              Charles Kerr, Scott set out on a tour of the English Lake District 
              with his brother John and friend Adam Ferguson. Kerr had been residing 
              in Cumberland for some time and was determined to persuade Scott 
              that its beauty excelled that of the Scottish Highlands. It was 
              while out riding during this trip that Scott first laid eyes on 
              Charlotte Carpenter. That evening Walter was introduced to her at 
              a ball and thereafter they saw each other daily. </p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/charlotte.jpg" width="226" height="280" align="left" alt="Lady Scott, engraved by George B. Shaw after James Saxon, 1871 (Corson P.1887)" hspace="10">Charlotte, 
              born in December 1770, was 27 years old. She was of French birth, 
              her surname having been changed from Charpentier, and always retained 
              a light French accent. She had lost both parents and was under the 
              guardianship of Lord Downshire. Scott proposed marriage after only 
              a three-week romance much to the disquiet of his parents. They were 
              unimpressed by Charlotte's national origins, concerned that she 
              might be a Catholic, and desired more information about her family. 
              Charlotte replied that her father had worked for the French Royal 
              Government but died when she was very young, that Lord Downshire 
              had been his intimate friend, and that she had a brother in the 
              East India Company. She was now a British citizen and had been christened 
              in the Church of England. It was primarily, though, the reassurance 
              that Charlotte's financial circumstances were stable that led Scott's 
              parents to withdraw their objection. Their hostility rapidly softened 
              when they learned that Charlotte's brother Charles had been a good 
              friend of Simon Haliburton of Muirhouselaw, a close friend and relative 
              of the Scotts. </p>
            <p>In fact, Charlotte's account of her background leaves many questions 
              unanswered. The date and reasons for her arrival in England and 
              the extent and nature of her father's acquaintance with Lord Downshire 
              (thirty years his junior) remain puzzles to this day. It is possible 
              that Charlotte herself was in the dark regarding many aspects of 
              her family history.</p>
            <p>With Downshire readily giving his consent, the wedding took place 
              on Christmas Eve 1797 at St Mary's Church in Carlisle. That night 
              Scott returned to Edinburgh with his bride to the house that he 
              had newly rented at 50 George Street (see <a href="homes.html">Homes</a>). 
              The couple remained happy until the death of Charlotte three decades 
              later on 15 May 1826.</p>
