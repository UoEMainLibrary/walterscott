            <p>A study of the relationship between Sir Walter Scott and James 
              Hogg (1770-1835), the Ettrick Shepherd, is important in the light 
              of the recent belated recognition of Hogg as a major Scottish writer. 
              Hogg's present standing, founded mainly on a new appreciation of 
              his most significant work <i>The Private Memoirs and Confessions 
              of a Justified Sinner</i>, is in stark contrast to the neglect that 
              he has suffered since Scott's day. Though Hogg did enjoy considerable 
              success and popularity during his lifetime, his fame was based on 
              his poetry, which is now all but forgotten and rarely read. His 
              success was also partly due to his association with Scott, whose 
              patronage and friendship was to provide Hogg with valuable contacts 
              and financial help.</p>
            <p>The two writers were both raised in the Scottish Borders, although 
              in Scott's case only partly. Scott's upbringing in <a href="homes.html">Sandyknowe 
              </a>with his grandparents initiated and influenced his entire literary 
              career, which started with the publication of a collection of Border 
              ballads in <a href="../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html"><i>The Minstrelsy 
              of the Scottish Border</i></a><i> </i>in 1802. It was while researching 
              this publication that he became acquainted with Hogg. </p>
            <p>Hogg was born in 1770 in the parish of Ettrick, a remote and isolated 
              community. When six years old, his father, a tenant-farmer became 
              bankrupt. Hogg was forced to leave school and to spend the rest 
              of his childhood in service on varius farms. Between the ages of 
              six and fifteen, Hogg claims to have neither read nor written, and 
              to have had experienced great difficulty when trying to write again 
              in his late teens. Nonetheless, his first poem was published in 
              the Scots Magazine when he was only twenty-three. He did not achieve 
              poetic fame though until 1813 when his long poem The Queen's Wake, 
              made the 'Ettrick Shephard' a literary celebrity but with a fame 
              depending on curiosity value. His writings were seldom judged objectively 
              without reference to Hogg's humble origins. Fame increased through 
              the Noctes Ambrosianae of Blackwood's Magazine, which purported 
              to represent the table-talk of the Blackwood group. These were mainly 
              the work of John Wilson ('Christopher North') though Hogg himself 
              also contributed and further popularized the picture of Hogg as 
              an untutored child of nature. 'a boozing buffoon'. Prints showed 
              him with open mouth roaring drunkenly. Butt of Blackwood wits: reaction 
              varied from anger to good-natured enjoyment, enjoyed the wide publicity 
              and frequently encouraged interest in him as an autodidact.</p>
            <p>His Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott offended Lockhart who 
              was at that time engaged on the official biography of his father-in-law. 
              He find Hogg tactless in speculating about Lady Scott's parentage 
              and comparing Scott's condition in the final stage of his illness 
              to that of a drunken man. Comments too on Scott's excessive sympathies 
              for 'old aristocracy of the country. Lockhart vetoed UK publication 
              so it was published by Harper and Brothers in New York, April 1834. 
              It did though appear in June 1835 in a Glasgow reprint (John Reid 
              &amp; Co.). Pirated edition: The Domestic Manners and Private Life 
              of Sir Walter Scott. Omitted passages objected to by Lockhart.</p>
            <p>Hogg was a shepherd working on the land of Scott's friend William 
              Laidlaw, and it was Hogg, raised in the true Border tradition, who 
              supplied Scott with some of the poetry and ballads which appear, 
              albeit altered, in the <i>Minstrelsy</i>. Both writers demonstrated 
              astonishing narrative sophistication, some of it certainly intuitive, 
              some of it clearly derived from their knowledge of oral Border narrative 
              traditions. However, where Scott's Romanticism looked to some extent 
              towards German or European models, Hogg's was deeply rooted in and 
              reflective of his traditional Scottish rural background. This had 
              everything to do with class - Scott was a staunch Edinburgh Tory 
              with aristocratic aspirations, educated in Edinburgh, while the 
              self-educated Hogg could never shake off the tag of the rustic 'Ettrick 
              Shepherd'.</p>
            <p>Hogg cut a rough figure among the Edinburgh intelligentsia, much 
              in the same way as Burns must have done a generation before, though 
              Hogg was never to achieve the latter's reputation during his lifetime. 
              This could be attributed to the fact that the Romantic fashion for 
              the peasant poet which had favoured Burns in the 1780s had all but 
              died out by the time Hogg was writing in the 1820s.</p>
            <p>As with so many of Scott's acquaintances, Hogg remained a lifelong 
              friend, and Scott aided his career as a writer wherever possible. 
              Scott recognized and acknowledged Hogg's raw genius, but was guilty, 
              along with his contemporaries, of misunderstanding Hogg's objectives 
              in his later work, particularly in his prose. In a letter to John 
              Murray he writes:</p>
            <p>&quot;Hoggs Tales are a great failure to be sure. With a very considerable 
              portion of original genius he is sadly deficient not only in correct 
              taste but in common tact&quot; (<i>Letters</i> V, p. 140).</p>
            <p>Scott was, however, a tireless and generous patron, helping his 
              friend through his own influence wherever possible. In one of several 
              letters to Lady Dalkeith on Hogg's behalf, Scott promises to assure 
              the Duke of Dalkeith, whose patronage Hogg was seeking, of Hogg's 
              &quot;skill &amp; character. His charge seems moderate and I will 
              answer for his honesty--&quot; (<i>Letters</i> I, p. 300).</p>
            <p>Scott's letters reveal his fondness for Hogg together with a patronizing 
              stance to his work and social demeanour. Hogg clearly did not assimilate 
              into fashionable Edinburgh society: a genius on the fringe, he struggled 
              for recognition and was eventually ridiculed by the very people 
              he worked for at <i>Blackwoods Magazine. </i> Scott's own son-in-law 
              and biographer, John Gibson Lockhart, a contributor to <i>Blackwoods</i>, 
              took a particular dislike to Hogg, not least when, following Scott's 
              death in 1832, Hogg published his <i>Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter 
              Scott</i>. Lockhart claimed that Hogg had 'insulted his [Scott's] 
              dust', though in exactly what way remains unclear, for Hogg displays 
              an unmistakable admiration for Scott:</p>
            <p>&quot;He was truly an extraordinary man; the greatest man in the 
              world. What are kings and Emperors compared with him? Dust and sand!&quot;</p>
            <p>Lockhart's dislike of Hogg is a reflection of Hogg's particular 
              difficulties with contemporary Edinburgh society. As Douglas Mack 
              points out, Lockhart's anger could be interpreted as that of a man 
              with aristocratic pretensions who finds the affairs of his father-in-law 
              and family discussed in print by a man of lowly social background. 
              Lockhart personified the gentrified, somewhat arrogant character 
              of Enlightenment Edinburgh which Hogg found so hard to penetrate, 
              and which to a large extent was responsible for the failure of his 
              work in the public eye. </p>
            <p>Despite Scott's ambivalence to Hogg's later work, there was more 
              to unite Scott and Hogg artistically than to separate them. Their 
              subject matter for example often coincided, including Edinburgh, 
              folklore, sympathy for the working classes, music, antiquarianism 
              and Calvinism. Even their narrative techniques seemed to compliment 
              each other with Scott's <a href="../works/novels/redgaun.html"><i>Redgauntlet</i></a> 
              and Hogg's <i>Private Memoirs and Confessions</i> <i>of a Justified 
              Sinner </i>(both published in 1824) - both are constructed through 
              fictional letters or diary entries with the voice of a fictional 
              editor interposed between the entries.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to compare their developments as writers. Both 
              started their literary careers with a mutual fascination for Border 
              ballads and traditions, and both first wrote poetry in the context 
              of these traditions before gradually developing their own style 
              of literary prose. Although both are now primarily regarded as novelists, 
              they achieved fame through their narrative verse. Hogg's success 
              during his lifetime arose almost entirely from his poetry, which 
              included <i>The Queen's Wake</i>, while Scott's meteoric career 
              took off with now relatively little read poems such as <a href="../works/poetry/marmion.html"><i>Marmion</i></a>, 
              <a href="../works/poetry/lady.html"><i>The Lady of the Lake</i></a> 
              and <a href="../works/poetry/rokeby.html"><i>Rokeby</i></a>. The 
              arrival of Byron on the literary scene, combined with the comparative 
              drop in interest in his poetry after 1813, convinced Scott to turn 
              his hand to prose. <a href="../works/novels/waverley.html"><i>Waverley</i></a> 
              was published in 1814. Hogg too saw the need to experiment with 
              new modes of narrative expression, which were to be found in the 
              novel form. This, though, is where their paths separated, as Scott's 
              success at novel writing was immediate and unconfined, while Hogg's 
              stature gradually diminished in the public eye.</p>
            <p>Both writers have also suffered posthumously from shortsighted 
              criticism, heavy editing and changes in literary taste, particularly 
              at the beginning of the twentieth century. Scott was enormously 
              popular on a global scale during his lifetime, and Hogg enjoyed 
              success through his poetry. By the beginning of the twentieth century 
              however, Scott's work had suffered from critical snobbery - in schools, 
              only his medieval romances remained on the shelves, and those more 
              by way of children's books. Hogg however suffered far more seriously, 
              and for a greater period of time. His <i>Confessions of a justified 
              Sinner</i> were edited and re-edited to the point where they bore 
              little artistic relation to Hogg's original conception, and were 
              all but lost to the world until the 1960s. It is only now, with 
              the help of new enlightened criticism and recent publications such 
              as the Sterling/South Carolina editions, that Hogg is finally taking 
              his rightful place next to Scott as one of Scotland's greatest literary 
              figures. Both writers were accomplished poets as well as novelists, 
              and their reputations are being saved from niche criticism and selectivity. 
              Both writers also have a part to play in each other's careers. The 
              accounts Scott and Hogg wrote of each other also form part of the 
              <a href="../corson.html">Corson Collection</a>. These provide an 
              insight into a fascinating partnership and rivalry.<font size="2"><br>
