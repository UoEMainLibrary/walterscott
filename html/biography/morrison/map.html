                <td width="54%">Morrison's somewhat disjointed and rambling 'Reminiscences'
                  give no clear indication of the circumstances leading to his
                  making a plan of Scott's Abbotsford estate. Scott's invitation
                  ('You must', said Sir Walter, 'make me a survey and plan of
                  Abbotsford.') is presented as the inspiration of a moment.
                  'I will begin', Morrison claims to have replied, 'in the first
                  place and make you a proper waterfall in the Rhymer's Glen'.
                  Having persuading Scott of the disadvantages of 'the present
                  formal affair', Morrison was permitted to have 'the largest
                  and most rugged stones tumbled to the narrowest pass in the
                  glen, and [...] the chinks stopped with moss; so that the water
                  fell irregular, and was forced to wander and find its way round
                  the rock'. Scott was 'much pleased', exclaiming, 'Here is the
                hand of the painter!'</td>

            </table>            <p>Morrison is, in fact, highly critical throughout
              of the layout of both the estate and house of Abbotsford. 'I was
              often at a loss',
              he writes, 'to reconcile Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s descriptions
              of scenery, which were excellent, to his practical taste, which
              was not always in good keeping; for, after all, Abbotsford is a
              strange jumble. If he had searched all over his property, he could
              not have built on a less interesting spot. The public road from
              Melrose to Selkirk passes within fifty yards of the front of his
              house, and is on a level with the chimney tops.' He seriously advised
              Scott, before building his garden walls, to 'lift or remove the
              whole to a more eligible situation, and, being built of hewn stone,
              the affair could be easily done'. Scott was greatly in need too
              of Morrison's advice on tree-planting, for 'he was too much given
              to plant in stripes or belts'. As for the interior of the house,
              it was 'certainly not in good taste&#8217;.</p>
            <p><img src="graphics/tolbooth2.jpg" alt="The Door of the 'Heart of Midlothian' by William Gibb (Corson F.3.b.MAXW.6)" width="176" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Scott
              would often join Morrison while he was engaged in surveying the
              estate, 'leaning on his favourite, Tam Purdy [i.e. Purdie],
              and tell me tales connected with the spot I might be surveying'.
              These often provoked Morrison, a self-proclaimed 'Whig and Cameronian',
               to express political views that differed radically from Scott's
              own. One such exchange was sparked by Scott's procurement of the
              door to Edinburgh's Old Tolbooth Prison (the 'Heart of Midlothian',
              see right) for use as the gateway leading from his house to the
              offices. Its
              'grim aspect' gave Morrison a 'disagreeable feeling' to think 'how
              many of our noble martyrs and patriots' had passed through it 'never
              to return, but to the scaffold and death'. 'But many a traitor',
              replied Scott, 'has passed also to receive his doom!' 'Yes', countered
              Morrison, 'your friend, Montrose, passed through it.' 'Noble martyr!',
              exclaimed
              Scott 'with great emotion'. Morrison comments that they
              'entertained very different sentiments respecting the character
              of Montrose', a hero to Tories and Jacobites and an oppressive
              turncoat to the Covenanters.</p>
            <p> <img src="graphics/dundee.jpg" width="214" height="250" align="right" alt="The Viscount Dundee, engraved by R.C. Bell after R. Williams (Corson P.1272" hspace="10">Morrison
              likewise records several similar exchanges concerning Montrose's
              descendent and fellow scourge of the Covenanters, John
              Graham of Claverhouse, the 'Great Dundee' to Scott and 'Bloody
              Clavers' to Morrison. Morrison recalls examining Williams's portrait
              of Claverhouse in Scott's study (see right) and observing that
              the
              depiction of Claverhouse in Scott's <em><a href="../../works/novels/mortality.html">Old
              Mortality</a></em> as one whom 'painters would love to limn and
              ladies to look on' could not have been based on the painting. The
              artist has portrayed him 'with red hair, a squint, and 'with an
              unnatural length between the nose and chin', which 'well accords'
              with the eye-witness description that Morrison's father had from
              an elderly friend: 'His arms were long, and reached to his knees,
              his red or frizzly, and his look altogether diabolical.' 'Your
              father and his acquaintance were Whigs, and drew a distorted picture.'
              'The painter there', said Morrison, 'has done the same.'</p>
            <p>The contradiction into which Morrison falls here -- does the painting
              of Claverhouse 'accord well' with his father's friend's description,
              or is it 'distorted' -- is typical of his highly entertaining but
              less than reliable 'Reminiscences'. Similarly, the twice-made claim
              that Scott's written descriptions were 'excellent' in contract
              to his 'practical sense' does not tally with the mockery of Scott's
              eulogies of St Mary's Loch and of other Border landscapes that
              leave Morrison cold.</p>
            <p>One suspects too that Morrison somewhat puffs up his role in his
              political debates with Scott. He recalls Scott's proposal to raise
              a volunteer regiment to put down civil unrest in 1819. Invited
              to become its engineer, Morrison proclaims: 'That depends on circumstances:
              I will, if I think you are in the right; if not, I will be of the
              other party. I am a Whig and Cameronian.' Yet, in a letter of December
              20, 1819, to his factor William Laidlaw (a close friend of Morrison),
              Scott confidently announces, &#8216;Morrison volunteers as our
              engineer' (<em>The Letters of Sir Walter Scott</em>, VI: 66). Scott,
              of course, may be indulging in wishful thinking, but it is as likely
              that Morrison fashions himself a rather more heroic and principled
              role in his 'Reminiscences' than he fulfilled in real life.</p>
            <p>Their political differences, however openly expressed, do not
              appear to have stood in the way of the friendship between Scott
              and Morrison. Morrison, in all events, commends his care for his
              employees and 'attention to the lower orders' which 'ill-accorded
              with his political principles'. As an example, he cites Scott's
              refusal to have the old public footpaths over his lands closed
              up as the
              Road
              Commissioner
              offered to do.</p>
            <p>A letter from Morrison to Scott, dated 20 June 1820, reveals that
              he made two versions of his plan of the Abbotsford estate.
              The sheet of paper used for his first attempt was not large enough
              to incorporate land purchased in the course of Morrison's preparation
              of the plan. He had thus been forced to affix an additional sheet
              to it. Morrison announces that he is preparing a neater
              and more durable copy on a larger sheet forScott's personal use,
              but suggests that the original would be adequate for the purposes
              of Scott's factor William Laidlaw and wood-forester Tom Purdie.
              It seems likely that it is the first version that Corson acquired.</p>
