                <td width="50%"><font color="#003366">J</font>ohn Morrison, the
                  son of a small farmer, was born in the Parish of Terregles,
                  Galloway, in 1782. As a boy, he attracted the interest of the
                  philanthropist Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, who paid
                  for his education in Dumfries and Edinburgh. The Earl believed
                  that emigration to America was the only means to relieve the
                  poverty of many of his countrymen. He had Morrison trained
                  as a land-surveyor with a view to employing him on the settlements
                  that he would found on Prince Edward Island (1803) and the
                  Red River (1812-16). While in Edinburgh, however, Morrison
                  also studied painting under the landscape and portrait painter
                  Alexander Nasmyth, and was to remain torn between his profession
                  and his artistic ambitions throughout his working life.</td>

            <p>On completing his studies, Morrison declined the offer of a position
              on one of the Earl's settlements, much to his protector's disappointment.
              He returned to his parents' farm of Fellend, near Ringford, Galloway,
              and combined farming with land-surveying. In 1805, he came to the
              attention of the great civil engineer Thomas Telford who was then
              constructing a new bridge over the River Dee at nearby Tongland.
              Telford engaged him to survey a projected railway from Glasgow
              to Berwick, and subsequently, to work on numerous building projects
              in Scotland, England and Wales. </p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="67%">Morrison remained in Telford's employ for several
                  years, then acted as surveyor for John Rennie (portrayed right),
                  builder of Leeds Bridge, Waterloo Bridge, and Southwark Bridge,
                  and designer of London Bridge. Morrison was forced to give
                  up his post with Rennie in order to assist his ailing father.
                  He took a new lease at Fellend, and tried once again to combine
                  farming and surveying. So unsuccessful was he that, on his
                  father's death in 1818, he gladly transferred the lease to
                  his brother Thomas. He continued to survey land for the local
                  nobility and gentry, and to provide advice on laying out grounds.
                  Following a lengthy illness, however, he decided to renounce
                  surveying and to try his luck as a painter.</td>

            <p>In a letter to Scott dated 20 May 1819, Morrison describes how
              he had returned to painting while illness excluded any more strenuous
              activity. Now that he has fully recovered, he is resolved to 'abandon
              a proffession [sic] that requires neither much taste nor imagination'
              in favour of 'one which I have ever loved' (National Library of
              Scotland MS 3890/100-01). The decision, Morrison insists, is not
              as reckless as it might first appear. He has kept in his hand as
              an artist throughout his professional life, and has been in the
              habit of sketching and painting scenes observed when surveying.
              In a further letter to Scott, dated 20 June 1820, he hopes that
              his newly acquired skill as a lithographer will prove a useful
              sideline (NLS MS 3891/67-68). The map of the Abbotsford estate
              that Morrison drew up for Scott over the coming months was intended
              to be his last piece of work before winding up his surveying business.</p>
            <p><img src="graphics/perth.jpg" alt="Gowrie House, Perth, engraved by  Gorway after John Morrison" width="250" height="250" hspace="10" align="right">Information
              is scarce on the last thirty years of Morrison's life. Morrison's
              own 'Reminiscences' published in <em>Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</em> (1843-44)
              treat his dealings with Scott as the central episode of his life
              and give little indication as to the success of his career change.
              Alexander Trotter, in his <em>East Galloway Sketches</em> (1901)
              relates that, having acquired a reputation for taking correct likenesses,
              Morrison was invited to Liverpool in 1821 to paint portraits. He
              failed to find steady work, however, and following a brief stay
              in London where he befriended Sir Thomas Lawrence, he returned
              to Galloway. It seems likely that he found himself forced once
              again to combine painting and surveying. The 1851 Census of Kirkcudbrightshire
              records his profession as 'civil engineer'. Trotter states that
              'some of Morrison's sketches with his workmanship acknowledged
              may be seen in the Abbotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels'.
              However, only one small illustration for <em>The Fair Maid of Perth</em> (vol.
              XI), a sketch of Gowrie House, Perth (see above right) is actually
              attributed to Morrison.</p>
            <p>In 1832 he published a volume of poems (<em>Poems of John Morrison</em>)
              which met with little success. Trotter suggests that the latter
              part of his career was blighted by ostracism. Having offended his
              former protector the Earl of Selkirk through a printed comment
              on his aunt, he became <em>persona non grata</em> to the gentry.
              The 1851 Census recalls that he lived alone with his unmarried
              sister Helen, a school-mistress, and his niece Jane Melville, an
              assistant teacher who became his heir. He died on 8 June 1853 and
              is buried in the graveyard of the Old Priory Church, Tongland.</p>
            <p><img src="graphics/train.jpg" alt="Photogravure of silhouette of Joseph Train (Corson B.CAW.2)" width="127" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Morrison
              is briefly recalled in a number of memoirs of Galloway life in
              the early nineteenth century. John Patterson's <em>Memoir of Joseph
              Train </em>(1857) paints an unflattering picture of a man 'of dogmatic
              assertions and high pretensions' (p. 58). Train (portrayed, right)
              recalled dining with Sir Walter Scott and Patterson: 'A pair of
              ptarmigans at table, which Sir Walter said he had received that
              day as a present from the North, was a treat to everyone present'
              except Morrison, 'who affirmed that these birds were as plentiful
              as pigeons in Galloway.' 'So great was the vanity of Morrison',
              Patterson continues, 'that even Sir Walter Scott was not allowed
              to pass uncontradicted.' <a href="../../portraits/artists/wilkie.html">Sir
              David Wilkie</a>'s recently completed
              group-portrait <em><a href="../../portraits/paintings/abbotfam.html">The Abbotsford Family</a></em> was exhibited to the company,
              only for Morrison to declare that 'it was neither like Sir Walter
              nor
              any
              of his
              family'. Scott's daughter Anne archly replied, 'Oh, I forgot, Mr
              Morrison, you are a painter yourself, and I have often heard it
              remarked, that there is no friendship in trade, but I never saw
              it verified before.' Perhaps, though, Train's acerbic recollections
              are coloured by rivalry with Morrison, as both competed to supply
              Scott with Galloway lore. (For Train's relations with Scott, see
              the pages on <a href="../../works/novels/mannering.html"><em>Guy
              Mannering</em></a> and <a href="../../works/novels/mortality.html"><em>Old
              Mortality</em></a>.)</p>
            <p>Malcolm M'L. Harper in his<em> Rambles in Galloway</em> (1896)
              describes Morrison as 'one of Galloway's most original characters
              in his day' (p. 115). 'In art', Harper regrets, 'he did not excel,
              but as an engineer and land surveyor he was distinguished; and
              had he possessed that steadiness of purpose necessary to success
              in life, he might have risen to eminence in that walk'. He was
              also 'somewhat of a humorist, and was famed for his pointed satirical
              remarks'. Friends recalled him as 'a vain as well as a proud man'
              who 'always endeavoured to leave the impression in company that
              he was 'something more than common humanity' (p. 116). Trotter
              acknowledges Morrison's reputation for vanity and condescension,
              but has some sympathy for his plight, arguing that Galloway could
              scarcely supply the quality of company to which he had been habituated
              from an early age!</p>
            <p>Morrison's dealings with Scott certainly bear witness to Morrison's
              conceit and spirit of contradiction but also give a taste of the
              (sometimes involuntary) humour that made him a favoured companion
              of many of Scott's peers in the literary and artistic worlds.</p>
