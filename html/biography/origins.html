            <h2><font color="#003366">Family Background</font></h2>
            <p>Walter Scott was born on August 15, 1771 in <a href="homes.html">College 
              Wynd</a>, Edinburgh. He was the ninth child of Walter Scott, Writer 
              to the Signet, and Anne Rutherford, but five of his siblings had 
              already died in infancy, and a sixth, Barbara, was to die when he 
              was five months old.</p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/father.jpg" width="205" height="250" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Walter Scott, Writer to the Signet, engraved by George B. Shaw after an unknown artist, 1871 (Corson P.1885)">Scott's 
              father was heir to a junior branch of the Scotts, a bellicose and 
              litigious clan who since the tenth century had played a prominent 
              role in the warfare and internecine strife that wracked the Border 
              region. On his mother's side, he descended from the Haliburtons 
              of Newmains who brought to the Scott family the hereditary right 
              of burial in Dryburgh Abbey.</p>
            <p>Walter senior was the first of his family to move to Edinburgh 
              and to follow a profession. His own father, Robert, had directed 
              him toward the Law, calculating that a Border lawyer should make 
              a healthy living out of his countrymen's interminable private feuds. 
              He enjoyed considerable success, rising to the position of senior 
              partner in the firm in which he served his apprenticeship. As a 
              Writer to the Signet, he was at the pinnacle of the sollicitor's 
              calling in Scotland with the privilege of appearing before the Court 
              of Session, the nation's supreme civil court. Scott's father was 
              a strict Calvinist, scrupulously honest in his professional life, 
              and rigid in his educational principles. He is affectionately caricatured 
              in the shape of Alexander Fairford in Scott's 1824 novel <i><a href="../works/novels/redgaun.html">Redgauntlet</a></i>.</p>

                <td width="59%">In April 1758, he married Anne Rutherford, eldest
                  daughter of John Rutherford, Professor of Medicine in the University
                  of Edinburgh (see portrait, right, by unknown artist). Rutherford
                  had studied in Leyden under the great Herman Boerhaave, a pioneer
                  of modern
                  methods
                  of
                  clinical
                  instruction.
                  Rutherford was appointed to the Chair of Theory and Practice
                  of Medicine at Edinburgh in 1726 where he proved highly influential
                  in introducing Boerhaave's teachings to the Scottish medical
                  profession. Some of his lecture notes and casebooks are held
                  by the <a href="http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/resources/collections/specdivision/manuscripts.shtml">Special
                Collections Division</a> of Edinburgh University Library). </td>

                  <td width="45%">On her father's side, Anne Rutherford (see
                    engraved portrait, right, after Watson Gordon) descended
                    from a clan of Border warriors and reivers, celebrated
                    in
                    many
                    a family legend. Her 
                    mother's family, the Swintons, was one of the oldest in
                    Scotland  and claimed descent from the Earls of Douglas.
                    It was his grandmother's 
                    aristocratic connections that gave the otherwise thoroughly
                     middle-class Scott his first introduction to Edinburgh's
                    high 
                    society circles. Anne had a great love of ballads and folk
                    traditions  and a passion for literature, both of which she
                    passed on to 
                    her son.</td>

            <p>In his early months, the young Walter (or 'Wattie' as he was known) 
              proved a robust, lively child. At the age of eighteen months, however, 
              he contracted polio, which would leave him lame for the rest of 
              his life. He was sent to his grandfather's home at Sandyknowe in 
              the Borders to see whether fresh air and exertion would mend his 
              health (see <a href="sandy.html">Sandyknowe and Early Childhood</a>).</p>
