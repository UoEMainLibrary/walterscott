                  in Fiction</i></font></h3>
            <p>Scott had been an enthusiastic novel-reader since his school years
              and had acquired not only an exhaustive knowledge of the English
              novel tradition but extensive familiarity with the classics of
              French, German, and Spanish fiction (see <a href="education.html">School
              and University</a> and <a href="beginning.html">Literary Beginnings</a>).
              According to his own account in the 'General Preface' to the 'Magnum
              Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels (1829), Scott's first experiments
              with prose fiction date from the turn of the nineteenth century.
              Two fragments survive (published as appendices to the 'General
              Preface'). <i>Thomas the Rhymer</i> was destined to be a 'tale
              of chivalry' in the style of Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of
              Otranto</i>, 'with plenty of Border characters, and supernatural
              incident'<i>. The Lord of Ennerdale</i> too was strongly influenced
              by prevailing Gothic models such as Walpole, Anne Radcliffe, and
              'Monk' Lewis. Neither work was carried beyond its first chapter.</p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/erskine.jpg" width="155" height="210" align="right" hspace="10" alt="William Erskine, photogravure after Sir Henry Raeburn, 1903 (Corson B.CAW.1)">Scott
              did not, though, abandon the ambition to write prose fiction. According
              to the General Preface (1829) to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of the
              Waverley Novels, he began work 'about the year 1805' on a novel
              entitled 'Waverley, or 'tis Fifty Years Since', inspired by tales
              heard from Jacobite veterans and by his own travels in the Highlands
              as an apprentice Writer to the Signet (see <a href="law.html">Professional
              Life</a>). Scott was intrigued by the fictional potential of the
              clash between the ancient, patriarchal customs of the Highlanders
              and the march of progress in the increasingly industrialized age
              of the Enlightenment. Having given the opening chapters to read
              to his friend Will Erskine (portrayed, right), an unfavourable
              reaction left Scott reluctant to risk the literary reputation newly
              won by the success of <a href="../works/poetry/minstrel.html"><i>The
              Lay of the Last Minstrel</i></a> (see <a href="poet.html">Scott
              the Poet</a>). The fragment<em> </em> then lay forgotten in a drawer
              until autumn 1813. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/edgeworth.jpg" alt="Maria Edgeworth, photogravure after Adam Buck, 1903 (Corson B.CAW.1)" width="197" height="240" hspace="15" align="left">Recent
              critics have queried the chronology of Scott's account, uncovering
              compelling textual and circumstantial evidence that Scott was actively
              engaged with the novel over the period 1808-10 and, indeed, may
              not have begun work on it before that time (see the <em><a href="../works/novels/waverley.html#composition">Waverley</a></em> page
              for the relevant arguments). They have also questioned Scott's
              account (in the General Preface) of the literary influences that
              led him to resume his experiment with fiction. The debt that Scott
              acknowledges to Maria Edgeworth (portrayed, left) is unarguably
              genuine. The success of her novels of Irish manners such as <i>Castle
              Rackrent </i>and <i>Ennui </i> led Scott to believe that his countrymen
              might be presented to the English novel-reading public 'in a more
              favourable light than they had been placed hitherto, and tend to
              procure sympathy for their virtues and indulgence for their foibles.'
              Edgeworth would later become a valued correspondent of Scott and
              acute reader of his novels. While acknowledging Edgeworth's influence,
              however, Scott downplays that of other practitioners of the 'national
              tale' or novel of regional manners such as Lady Morgan, Jane Porter,
              and Elizabeth Hamilton. In so doing and in backdating the genesis
              of <em>Waverley</em> to 1805, Scott's first novel thus appears
              to pre-empt rather than respond to a literary mode.</p>
            <p>A further influence, possibly overstated by Scott, was the editorial
              work undertaken for John Murray on Joseph Strutt's unfinished romance
              of fifteenth-century England <i>Queenhoo-Hall</i> (published 1808),
              to which Scott added two concluding chapters of his own. Scott
              attributed the commercial failure of <i>Queenhoo-Hall</i> to Strutt's
              excessively archaic language and desire to vaunt his antiquarian
              knowledge. He felt that it would be possible to write a historical
              romance more readily comprehensible to the general reader but feared
              there was little appetite for tales of medieval chivalry.The enthusiastic
              public and critical response to the description of Highland landscape
              and manners in Scott poem <a href="../works/poetry/lady.html"><i>The
              Lady of the Lake</i></a> (1810) persuaded him that a prose narrative
              of more recent history, with a Highland setting, might have a better
              chance of success.</p>

            <h3><font color="#003366"><i><a name="waverley"></a>Waverley</i></font></h3>
            <p>According to Scott's account in the 'General Preface' to the 'Magnum
              Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels (questioned by some recent
              critics and biographers), the <i>Waverley</i> manuscript was mislaid
              during his move to <a href="homes.html">Abbotsford</a> in 1811.
              One day in autumn 1813, however, Scott claims to have come across
              the manuscript in a drawer while rummaging for fishing tackle.
              He reread it, was persuaded that it had potential, and resolved
              to complete it. He was bolstered in this resolution by the disappointing
              sales of his recent narrative poem <a href="../works/poetry/rokeby.html"><i>Rokeby</i></a> and
              the pressing financial difficulties of <a href="ballant.html">John
              Ballantyne</a>'s publishing business, in which Scott was silent
              half-partner (see <a href="finance.html">Financial Hardship</a>).
              Consulted once again on the completion of the first volume, Will
              Erskine reversed his original opinion, and warmly encouraged Scott.
              The second and third volumes were completed in an extraordinary
              three-week burst in June 1814, and <i><a href="../works/novels/waverley.html">Waverley</a></i> (with
              the subtitle updated to ''tis <i>Sixty</i> Years Since'), published
              on 7 July, a few weeks before Scott's forty-third birthday.</p>
            <p><img src="../graphics/waverley.jpg" width="188" height="250" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Mac Ivor Warned of His Fate by the Grey Spirit, engraved by James Mitchell after Charles Robert Leslie, 1832 (Corson P.3469)">The
              novel (illustrated, right) was published anonymously and, in order
              to preserve Scott's incognito, the manuscript had been copied out
              in John Ballantyne's hand before going to print.<i> </i>Scott's
              novels would continue to be published anonymously or under pseudonyms
              until 1827 when Scott admitted to his authorship at a public dinner.
              Only those closest to Scott were let into the secret of his authorship,
              though thousands more came to suspect it. There is no clear single
              reason why Scott wished to remain anonymous, but a number of factors
              contributed to his decision. Firstly, the novel was not considered
              a serious genre at the time, especially in comparison with the
              sort of narrative verse that Scott had hitherto published. Secondly,
              writing fiction would not have been regarded as a decorous pastime
              for a Clerk of the Session (see <a href="../../biography/law.html">Professional
              Life</a>). Finally, Scott viewed the publication of <i>Waverley</i> as
              an experiment upon the public taste and wished to protect his reputation
              should the book fail. As time went on, though, and the Waverley
              Novels became ever more popular, Scott's anonymity undoubtedly
              also appealed to his taste for romance and mystery. </p>

                <td width="46%"><i>Waverley</i> was an astonishing success, the
                  first edition selling out within two days of publication. The
                  critics too were warm in their praise, particularly Francis
                  Jeffrey (portrayed, left) in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> who
                  extolled its truth to nature, fidelity to 'actual experience',
                  force of characterization, and vivid description. Some reviewers,
                  though, notably John Wilson Croker for the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
                  expressed reservations about the propriety of mixing history
                  and romance. Despite enduring critical doubts about its legitimacy
                  as a genre, <i>Waverley</i> marks the birth of the historical
                  novel in English.</td>

                  Novels'</i></font></h3>
            <p>Over the next five years, Scott wrote a further eight novels set
              in seventeenth- or eighteenth-century Scotland. It is substantially
              upon these works that Scott's critical reputation now rests. <i><a href="../works/novels/mannering.html">Guy
              Mannering</a></i> (1815) and <i><a href="../works/novels/antiquary.html">The
              Antiquary</a></i> (1816), Scott's own favourite amongst his novels,
              complete, with <i>Waverley</i>, an ideal trilogy illustrating three
              periods of Scottish history from the 1740s to the 1800s. Each volume
              brought further commercial success. Critical opinion was broadly
              favourable though there was the first hint of charges that would
              be regularly leveled at Scott's future novels: that he repeated
              his characters under different names, failed to make his Scots
              dialogue sufficiently comprehensible for an English audience, relied
              excessively on the supernatural, or was irreverent in matters of
              religion. </p>
            <p align="left"><img src="../graphics/mortality.jpg" width="248" height="250" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Old Mortality, engraved by William Home Lizars after William Allan, 1820 (Corson P.2901)">For
              his next publication Scott made a further attempt to mystify the
              public, adopting the <i>nom de plume</i> of Jedediah Cleishbotham,
              schoolmaster at the fictional village of Gandercleuch. Cleishbotham
              purported to be editing the narratives of one Peter Pattieson which
              in turn were supposed to be based on stories told by the landlord
              of the local inn. As the volume was to be published by Blackwood
              rather than Constable, Scott hoped that the public would believe
              a new writer had appeared to challenge the supremacy of the 'Author
              of <i>Waverley</i>'. <i>Tales of My Landlord</i> (1816) was originally
              to consist of four short novels on Scottish regional themes. However, <i><a href="../works/novels/mortality.html">The
              Tale of Old Mortality</a></i>, set during the anti-Covenanting
              campaign of John Graham of Claverhouse, grew to fill three volumes,
              and of the other stories, only <i><a href="../works/novels/dwarf.html">The
              Black Dwarf</a> </i>was completed and published along with it.
              The <i>Tales</i> matched the commercial success of the earlier
              trilogy, and critics concurred with Scott's own assessment that <i>Old
              Mortality</i> (illustrated, above right) was his best work to date.
              They equally, however, shared Scott's view that <i>The Black Dwarf</i>,
              a tale of family rivalry in early eighteenth-century Scotland,
              retrod old ground.</p>

                  between the style of <i>Tales of My Landlord</i> and that of
                  the 'author of Waverley'. Nonetheless, in crediting his next
                  novel <a href="../works/novels/robroy.html"><i>Rob Roy</i></a> (1817)
                  to the latter, and reverting to Constable as a publisher, Scott
                  was diverted by the idea of bringing his two <i>noms de plume </i>into
                  direct competition. <i>Rob Roy </i>(illustrated, left) , a
                  tale of the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715, was a further critical
                  and commercial triumph, the original print run of 10,000, a
                  huge figure for the time, being bought up in two weeks. It
                  remains to this day among Scott's most widely read and translated
                  novels. The fortune of Scott's novels had by now eclipsed that
                  of his increasingly unsuccessful verse narratives. 1817 saw
                  the publication of Scott's final long poem, <a href="../works/poetry/harold.html"><i>Harold
                  the Dauntless </i></a>. Hereafter, he would work predominantly

              have a tragic conclusion, its tale of foredoomed love immediately
              caught the public imagination. It inspired many artists and gave
              rise to numerous stage and musical adaptations, most famously Donizetti's <i>Lucia
              di Lammermoor</i>. Its companion-piece <i><a href="../works/novels/montrose.html">A
              Legend of Montrose</a></i>, set during the Royalist Earl of Montrose's
              Highland campaign against the Covenanters in 1644, has remained
              somewhat in its shadow. Its mercenary anti-hero, Captain Dalgetty,
              however has since been recognized as one of Scott's finest comic
              characters.</p>

                  set in twelfth-century England, was published under a new pseudonym
                  Laurence Templeton, which again fooled almost no-one. The novel
                  (illustrated, right) rapidly became an international phenomenon,
                  launching Scott's continental vogue and providing the blueprint
                  for the historical novel across Europe. In Britain, it played
                  a major role in sparking the nineteenth-century fascination
                  for all things medieval.</td>

              Scott did not immediately seek to replicate the success of <i>Ivanhoe</i> with
              another chivalric romance. His next two novels returned to a Scottish
              setting. The <a href="../works/novels/monastery.html"><i>Monastery</i></a> and
              its sequel <i><a href="../works/novels/abbot.html">The Abbot</a></i> (both
              1820) were set in the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. If the former
              disappointed many readers (including Scott himself), the latter,
              dealing with Mary's escape from imprisonment, fully restored his
              reputation. Its success helped Scott overcome his initial misgivings
              about his ability to inhabit the sixteenth-century imaginatively,
              and his next novel <i><a href="../works/novels/kenilw.html">Kenilworth</a></i> (1821)
              was set in Elizabethan England. Scott, by this stage, was writing
              at a feverish rate, and before the end of 1821 had published a
              further novel, <i><a href="../works/novels/pirate.html">The Pirate</a></i>,
              set in early seventeenth-century Shetland and Orkney. Excluded
              from the relatively limited twentieth-century Scott canon, <i>The
              Abbot</i> and <i>The Pirate</i> remained amongst Scott's most popular
              works throughout the nineteenth-century, providing source material
              for many Victorian artists, and inspiring tourist pilgrimages to
              Loch Leven (portrayed, above left) and the Northern Isles. <i>Kenilworth</i> too
              was a major European success and, long dismissed as a succession
              of historical tableaux, has recently enjoyed a critical revival.<br>
            </p>
            <p align="left">Scott maintained his phenomenal rate of production
              with <i><a href="../works/novels/nigel.html">The Fortunes of Nigel</a></i> in
              May 1822 and <i><a href="../works/novels/peak.html">Peveril of
              the Peak</a></i> in January 1823. With these works he returned
              to the seventeenth century. The former is set shortly after the
              Union of the Crowns and traces the efforts of a Scottish nobleman
              to protect his inheritance at the court of King James VI and I.
              The latter deals with the so-called Popish Plot of 1678. Although
              Scott retained his popularity with the reading public, critical
              opinion was by now divided. Increasingly, Scott was charged with
              over-hasty composition, careless plotting, and the duplication
              of characters and situations. Reviewers repeatedly insinuated that
              he was now writing less for fame than fortune.</p>

              further novels appeared in 1823. <i><a href="../works/novels/durward.html">Quentin
              Durward</a></i>, set in fifteenth-century France, was Scott's first
              fictional venture onto the continent of Europe. Despite being his
              most critically acclaimed work since <i>Ivanhoe</i>, sales were
              slow. Scott and his publishers began to fear that they were glutting
              the market and that the public were struggling to believe that
              the 'Author of Waverley' could be solely responsible for such a
              rapid succession of novels. In stark contrast, <i>Quentin Durward</i> (illustrated,
              above right) caused a similar sensation in France to<i> Waverley</i> in
              Scotland and <i>Ivanhoe</i> in England. The vogue for the novel
              subsequently spread across Europe, eventually awakening renewed
              interest in Britain. Although it has fallen out of critical favour
              in the English-speaking world, it remains one of Scott's most translated
              works. Scott's next work <a href="../works/novels/well.html"> <i>St.
              Ronan's Well</i></a>, published after a tactical pause in December
              1823, was another bold departure. His only work with a nineteenth-century
              setting, it portrays the domestic tragedies and comedies of a small
              Scottish spa-town and bears testimony to Scott's admiration for
              Jane Austen. It was perhaps Scott's least favourably reviewed novel,
              with critics censuring Scott for 'descending' to a lesser genre
              befitting only mediocre talents. </p>

                  left). Now regarded as amongst the finest of the Waverley novels,
                  its mixture of epistolary and narrative sequences was widely
                  seen as a throwback to the conventions of the eighteenth-century
                  novel. Set during a fictional late eighteenth-century Jacobite
                  Rebellion in the Border region, it is among Scott's most autobiographical
                  works, containing echoes of his apprenticeship to the Law (see <a href="law.html">Professional
                  Life</a>) and an affectionate caricature of his father (see <a href="origins.html">Family
                  Background</a>). It was one of Scott's personal favourites

            <p align="left">The critics were relieved to see Scott return to
              the high Middle Ages with <i>Tales of the Crusaders </i>(1825).
              Scott here united two novels, <i><a href="../works/novels/talisman.html">The
              Talisman</a></i>, set in Palestine during the Third Crusade, and <i><a href="../works/novels/betrothed.html">The
              Betrothed</a></i>, a tale of border conflicts between Anglo-Norman
              and Welsh barons. Featuring Saladin and Richard the Lionheart in
              prominent roles, the former gave rise to further debate on the
              propriety of mingling historical facts and personages with fiction.
              As Scott and his publishers had hoped, though, its virtues nonetheless
              distracted critics and public from the shortcomings of its companion
              piece. Particularly in Europe, <i>The Talisman</i> remains a highly
              popular novel, though largely promoted as a work for children.</p>

                <td width="46%">The winter of 1825-26 saw the economic recession

                  insolvency (see<a href="finance.html"> Financial hardship</a>).
                  A further blow came in May 1826 with the death of Scott's wife <a href="marriage.html">Charlotte</a>.
                  Begun before the crisis, Scott's next novel <i><a href="../works/novels/cavalier.html">Woodstock</a></i> (illustrated,

            <p align="left">As Scott fought to pay off his debts during the last
              six years of his life, his fictional production dropped off. His
              creative energy was primarily expended on the biography of <a href="../works/prose/napoleon.html">Napoleon</a> (1827-8)
              and the lucrative <a href="../works/prose/grandfather.html"><i>Tales
              of a Grandfather</i></a> (1828-31) and <i>History of Scotland</i> (1829).
              He nonetheless published four further volumes of fiction. <i><a href="../works/novels/canongate.html">Chronicles
              of the Canongate</a></i> (1827) was credited to a new <i>nom de
              plume</i>, Mr. Chrystal Croftangry, and contained two short-stories: <a href="../works/novels/widow.html">'The
              Highland Widow</a>', and<a href="../works/novels/drovers.html"> 'The
              Two Drovers'</a>, and a novella, <a href="../works/novels/daughter.html">'The
              Surgeon's Daughter'</a>. Despite lukewarm reviews, Scott considered
              the two short stories among his finest work, an opinion shared
              by many recent critics. The Second Series of <i>Chronicles of the
              Canongate</i> was composed entirely of the novel <i><a href="../works/novels/fairmaid.html">The
              Fair Maid of Perth</a></i> (1828). Set in late fourteenth-century
              Scotland, it was Scott's last major commercial and critical success
              as a writer of fiction. </p>

              returned to the fifteenth-century dynastic quarrels of <i>Quentin
              Durward</i> for his next novel <i><a href="../works/novels/geierstein.html">Anne
              of Geierstein</a></i> (1829) (illustrated, left). To his surprise,
              it was relatively well received by both public and critics, though
              some of the latter shared his own opinion that the factual elements
              of the plot were more interesting than the purely fictional. Finally,
              in December 1831, ten months before Scott's death, his last two
              novels <i><a href="../works/novels/robert.html">Count Robert of
              Paris</a></i> and <i><a href="../works/novels/dangerous.html">Castle
              Dangerous</a></i> were published together as a Fourth Series of <i>Tales
              of My Landlord</i>. The former was set in Byzantium during the
              First Crusade, the latter in the Scottish Borders during the Wars
              of Independence. Although Scott barely considered them 'seaworthy',
              the public remained faithful. Critical reaction was uneffusive
              but largely respectful, though subsequent commentators regarded
              them as the weakest part of Scott's oeuvre.</p>
            <p align="left">Perhaps, though, Scott's greatest literary commitment
              in the last years of his life was in revising his fiction for the
              'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels published from 1829
              onwards. In addition, Scott wrote lengthy introductions to each
              volume and added copious contextual notes. The 'Magnum Opus' remained
              the standard edition of Scott throughout the Victorian period and
              its critical status has only recently been challenged by the Edinburgh
              Edition (see <a href="../publications.html">Recent Publications</a>).</p>
