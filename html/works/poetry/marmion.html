                    <p>In late 1806 Scott began to write a poem on one of the
                      greatest disasters in Scottish history, the battle of Flodden
                      Field (1513), where an English army inflicted heavy losses
                      on the Scots, killing King James IV and most of his nobles.
                      One of Scott's correspondents, Anna Seward queried whether
                      it might not be too offensive to Scottish pride to commemorate
                      such an event in verse. Scott replied that at Flodden 'all
                      was lost <i>but our honour</i>', making it an eminently
                      suitable subject for a poet (letter of February 20, 1807).
                      Much of the poem was written at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Ashestiel</a>,
                      and the epistles to friends which preface each of the six
                      cantos describe the effects of the changing seasons upon
                      its scenery. Work on the poem was delayed by Scott's editorial
                      commitments on the <i>Works of John Dryden</i> and by his
                      efforts to disentangle the financial affairs of his brother,
                      Tom. It was finally completed on January 22, 1808, and
                      published on February 22. </p>

              poem concerns the designs of Lord Marmion, a favourite of Henry
              VIII, upon a wealthy heiress, Clara de Clare. In order to remove
              her fianc&eacute;, Sir Ralph De Wilton, he forges a letter implicating
              him in a treasonable plot. In this, he is assisted by his mistress,
              Constance De Beverley, a perjured nun, who thus hopes to reconquer
              his affection. De Wilton claims the right to defend his honour
              in combat but is defeated by Marmion and forced to flee abroad.
              In order to escape Marmion, Clara takes refuge in a convent. Marmion
              abandons Constance who is condemned to death for breaking her vows
              and walled up alive in the convent of St. Hilda on the Holy Island
              at Lindisfarne. Before her death, she consigns to the Abbess documents
              proving De Wilton's innocence. De Wilton, meanwhile, has re-entered
              the country disguised as a pilgrim. He follows Marmion to Scotland
              where he has gone to make overtures for peace at the Scottish court
              (and to assess the Scots' battle-readiness). The Abbess finds De
              Wilton in Edinburgh and hands over the documents. De Wilton shows
              these to Marmion's host, the Earl of Angus, who equips him with
              armour and readmits him to the order of knighthood. The battle
              of Flodden Field is fought before De Wilton can proceed further
              against Marmion. Marmion is killed in the battle. De Wilton fights
              with distinction, regains his honour and estates, and marries Clara. </p>

            <p><i>Marmion</i> was an even greater commercial success than <a href="minstrel.html"><i>The
                  Lay of the Last Minstrel</i></a> The first (exorbitantly priced)
                  edition of 2,000 copies sold out in under two months, and by
                  the end of May 1808 the poem was already into its third edition.
                  Frequently reprinted, <i>Marmion</i> remained a best-seller
                  throughout the nineteenth century. </p>
            <p>Critical response, however, was a good deal cooler. There was
              widespread censure of the opening epistles, which were felt to
              intrude upon the narrative. The plot was judged obscure and, in
              these pre-Byronic days, the character of Marmion, a mixture of
              villainy and magnanimity, was felt to be unsuitable for a poetic
              hero. A particularly pointed critique was offered by Francis Jeffrey
              in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. For Jeffrey, there was too much
              in he poem that was 'flat and tedious' where Scott appeared merely
              to be vaunting his historical knowledge. He objected to the anachronistic
              vogue for chivalry that Scott had fostered and, as an advocate
              of peace with France, bridled at the bellicose sentiments of the
              introductory epistles. None of this, however, hindered Scott's
              mounting vogue. This had now reached such a height that Constable
              was able to commission a portrait of the poet from the celebrated
              painter <a href="../../portraits/artists/raeburn.html">Sir Henry
              Raeburn</a>.</p>
