              began work on <i>Harold the Dauntless</i>, his last long verse
              narrative, in October 1815, shortly after completing <a href="waterloo.html"><i>The
              Field of Waterloo</i></a>, and while busy on <i>Paul's Letters
              to his Kinsfolk</i>. The poem - in Scott's own words, 'a strange,
              rude story' (letter to John Morrit, 22 December 1815) -- was inspired
              by the Viking legends of the Berserkers. Scott was an enthusiastic
              and knowledgeable reader of the Old Norse sagas. His library at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> contained
              over a hundred works relating to ancient Icelandic poetry and has
              recently been described as 'one of the best-stocked Scandinavian
              libraries in Britain' (Wawn, Andrew, 'Foreword' to Scott, Walter, <i>The
              Pirate</i> (Lerwick: The Shetland Times Ltd., 1996), p. XII). Composition
              was rapid, but Scott was dissatisfied with the poem and, fearing
              that his poetic vein was exhausted, resolved to make no further
              experiments in narrative verse. It was published on January 30,
              1817 as another work by 'the author of the <a href="triermain.html">Bridal
              of Triermain</a>'. Always fond of mystifications, Scott was again
              curious to see whether critics and public would detect his hand
              in the work.</p>

            <p>The poem's hero Harold, son of the Norse King Witikind, is appalled
              when his dying father receives Christian Baptism in exchange for
              a grant of Church lands. In protest at the betrayal of Viking ideals,
              he quits home. On his travels he meets and woos Princess Metelill
              who is already betrothed to the English Lord William. The girl's
              father is virulently opposed to his suit, considering Harold a
              barbarous Pagan. Meanwhile, the Church authorities plot to have
              Harold disinherited. He reacts violently but is persuaded to undertake
              a knightly quest, during which he encounters Witikind's ghost who
              tells him that he is condemned to wander restlessly until his son
              repents. Chancing upon Metelill's wedding procession, Harold kills
              her father and is barely prevented from killing the groom by own
              his servant, Gunnarr. Having reached the destination of his quest-journey,
              a castle, he finds himself plunged into the region of the dead
              where preparations are being made for his own arrival. He confronts
              and destroys the Odinic spirit which rules over the region and
              rescues Gunnarr from &Oacute;&eth;inn. Gunnarr turns out to be
              the Danish maiden Eivir in disguise. Harold announces his intentions
              to receive baptism and to marry Eivir, and his father's troubled
              spirit is able to rest in peace.</p>

            <p>Few critics penetrated the mystery of the poem's authorship, most
              regarding it as a second-rate imitation of Scott himself. <i>Blackwood's</i> considered
              it 'an elegant, sprightly and delightful little poem' but 'generally
              inferior to the works of Mr Scott, in vigour and interest'. For
              the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, it possessed a 'caricature resemblance'
              to Scott's verse, while the <i>Monthly Review</i> lamented 'faults
              engendered by a servile imitation of Mr Scott's bad grammar and
              discordant versification'. Such comments, combined with indifferent
              sales, did nothing to dissuade Scott from the opinion that his
              future lay with prose fiction.</p>
