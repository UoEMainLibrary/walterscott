              the poems that Scott intended to include in the third volume of
              the <a href="minstrelsy.html"><i>Minstrelsy</i></a> was 'a long
              poem [...] a kind of Romance of Border Chivalry, in a Light Horseman
              sort of stanza' (letter to George Ellis, December 1802). This was
              the first draft of the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel </i>which Scott
              had begun in <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Lasswade</a> in
              summer or autumn 1802. The four-beat lines that create its distinctive
              galloping rhythm were influenced by a recital that Scott had heard
              of Coleridge's <i>Christabel</i>. As Scott, at the Countess of
              Dalkeith's suggestion, wove the local legend of the goblin Gilpin
              Horner into his original tale of Border rivalries, the poem rapidly
              grew too long for inclusion in the <i>Minstrelsy</i>, and he began
              to conceive of it as a separate volume. As he worked on the poem
              he received warm encouragement from friends such as George Ellis,
              William Erskine, and George Cranstoun, and from William and Dorothy
              Wordsworth who paid Scott an unexpected visit in September 1803.
              Professional and other literary engagements (including the expanded
              edition of the <i>Minstrelsy</i>) delayed completion of the poem,
              as did Scott's move to <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Ashestiel.</a> The <i>Lay</i> was
              eventually finished in August 1804 and published on January 12,
              1805.</p>

              poem deals with a sixteenth-century Border feud. The story is told,
              over a century and a half later, by an aging minstrel who receives
              hospitality at Newark Castle from Ann, Duchess of Buccleuch. In
              return, he recites a tale concerning the Duchess's family. He sings
              of her ancestor, the widowed Lady of Branksome Hall, whose husband
              has been killed in a quarrel with a party that included Lord Cranstoun.
              Fiercely opposed to the love affair that develops between Cranstoun
              and her daughter, Margaret, she resorts to sorcery in an effort
              to prevent their marriage. She sends one of her retainers, Sir
              William Deloraine, to Melrose Abbey to recover a magic book from
              the tomb of the wizard Michael Scott. On his way back, Deloraine
              meets and fights with Cranstoun and is wounded by him. Cranstoun
              bids his page, a goblin-like figure who has mysteriously attached
              himself to him, to take Deloraine to Branksome Hall. The goblin
              page discovers Michael Scott's book on Deloraine's person and,
              in a spirit of pure mischief, uses it to lure Lady Branksome's
              infant son into the woods. Here the boy is captured by his mother's
              English enemy, Lord Dacre. Lord Dacre has gathered together a force
              to punish Deloraine for breaking a truce and plundering the lands
              of Sir Richard Musgrave. They lay siege to Branksome and demand
              that the Lady hand over her wounded retainer. She proposes instead
              that Deloraine defend himself against the charge in single combat
              with Musgrave. As a Scottish force is rapidly approaching, Dacre
              reluctantly accepts, promising that, should Deloraine prove victorious,
              he will return the Lady's son. With the help of his goblin page,
              Cranstoun assumes the form of the wounded Deloraine and defeats
              Musgrave. The child is restored, and the grateful Lady agrees to
              the marriage of Cranstoun and Margaret. At the wedding feast the
              ghost of Michael Scott appears and reclaims the goblin-page as
              his own servant.</p>

            <p>The <i>Lay</i> was an immediate publishing phenomenon, bringing
              Scott instant fame. There were six editions within three years,
              with sales rising to 27,000 copies within a decade, unparalleled
              figures for poetry. In the first instance of Scott's impact upon
              tourism in Scotland, the description of the moonlit Melrose Abbey
              (Canto II, stanza 1) brought a stream of sightseers to the ruined
              Abbey and led to it becoming a popular subject with nineteenth-century
              painters. The poem's fans included even the Prime Minister, William
              Pitt, who recited passages from the poem at his dinner table.</p>
            <p>The critics too were broadly favourable. Francis Jeffrey in the <i>Edinburgh
                Review</i> thought that many passages were 'in the very first
                rank of poetical excellence'. The <i>Critical Review</i> praised
                the skill with which Scott had refined the 'rich but unpolished
                ore' of ballad poetry. The <i>Annual Review</i> thought it 'elegant,
                spirited, and striking' and welcomed the move away from the stiffness
                of classical poetics. Other journals, though, such as the <i>Literary
                Journal</i> and <i>Monthly Review</i>, thought Scott guilty of
                prosaic and irregular versification, and found the plot both
                obscure and far-fetched. Many critics too (including Jeffrey)
                considered the goblin page beneath the dignity of the poem. Nonetheless,
                the <i>Lay</i>'s success with the public determined the line
                that Scott's work was to take over the next nine years.</p>
