              1815), Scott burned to see the scene of Napoleon's final defeat 
              and to visit newly conquered Paris. Continental Europe had been 
              closed to British visitors for more than a decade, and Scott had 
              never before travelled abroad. In August, he set sail for Belgium, 
              hoping to recuperate his expenses by writing a series of imaginary 
              letters describing his travels. These were to be published as <i><a href="../prose/kinsfolk.html">Paul's 
              Letters to His Kinsfolk</a> </i>(1816). Scott was amongst the first 
              British civilians to view the battlefield at Waterloo, accompanied 
              by General Adam's aide-de-camp, Captain Campbell, and Major Pryse 
              Gordon. Mixing personal observation with information gained from 
              his escorts and from other participants in the battle, he began 
              work on a poem, profits from which would go to a fund set up for 
              widows and orphans of soldiers. Proceeding to Paris, Scott obtained 
              further details from Allied officers and spoke with the Duke of 
              Wellington himself, whose lack of conceit and pretension greatly 
              impressed him.</p>
            <p>The poem was sent to <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James 
              Ballantyne</a> before the end of August and went to press in October. 
              Pre-empting the cool reaction of many subsequent readers, Ballantyne 
              made numerous objections and queries, taking a particular dislike 
              to the opening line ('Fair Brussels, thou art far behind'). For 
              the most part, Scott stood by his original text but reluctantly 
              followed Ballantyne's advice in toning down reminiscences of his 
              own <i><a href="lord.html">The Lord of the Isles</a></i> and <a href="lady.html"><i>The 
              Lady of the Lake</i></a>. </p>

            <p>An initial run of 6,000 copies appeared on October 23, 1815. The 
              poem sold well and went into a third edition by the end of year. 
              The critics, however, were unimpressed. For the <i>Critical Review</i>, 
              it was 'absolutely the poorest, dullest, least interesting composition 
              that has <i>hitherto</i> issued from the author of <i><a href="rokeby.html">Rokeby</a></i>'. 
              The poem's worthy purpose prevented other journals from being quite 
              so harsh, but there was widespread censure of clumsy phrasing and 
              other signs of authorial haste. Although <i>The Field of Waterloo</i> 
              counted Byron amongst its few admirers, it is now best remembered 
              through an anonymous squib:</p>
            <p align="center">On Waterloo's ensanguined plain<br>
              Full many a gallant man was slain,<br>
              But none, by sabre or by shot,<br>
            Fell half so flat as Walter Scott.</p>
