                  <p>Scott's interest in the folk traditions of the Border region
                    stemmed from early childhood stays at <a href="../../biography/sandy.html">Sandyknowe</a>,
                    when he heard ballads from the lips of his grandmother Barbara
                    Scott and his favourite Aunt Jenny. As an older boy, he thrilled
                    to the medieval ballads collected in Bishop Thomas Percy's <i>Reliques
                    of Ancient English Poetry</i>. Scott began collecting ballads
                    himself in yearly trips to the Borders from 1792 onwards.
                    He first had the idea of publishing a collection in 1796,
                    but it was not until he renewed contact with his old schoolfriend,
                    the printer <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
                    Ballantyne</a>, that the idea bore fruit. In 1799 Ballantyne
                    had published <i><a href="apology/home.html">An Apology for
                    Tales of Terror</a></i> which
                    contained ballads by <a href="apology/poets.html#southey">Robert
                    Southey</a>, <a href="apology/introduction.html#lewis">Matthew
                    'Monk' Lewis</a>,
                    <a href="apology/poets.html#aikin">John Aikin</a>, and Scott himself (see <a href="../../biography/beginning.html">Literary
                    Beginnings</a>). He now welcomed the idea of publishing a
                    volume devoted entirely to ballads, a genre rendered newly
                fashionable by Wordsworth's and Coleridge's <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> (1798).</p></td>

              of Selkirkshire (see <a href="../../biography/law.html">Professional 
              Life</a>). In addition to his own (often hazardous) travels in Ettrick 
              Forest and Liddesdale, he received assistance from other ballad-collectors, 
              including John Leyden, Robert Jamieson, Robert Surtees, George Ellis, 
              and Bishop Percy himself. Scott's approach to authenticating, editing, 
              and arranging material caused controversy at the time and falls 
              short of modern standards of scholarship. He relied on an innate 
              'feeling' for the genuine article and did not hesitate to 'improve' 
              ballads, changing words, inserting new stanzas, mending rhymes and 
              rhythms, fusing various versions, and sometimes setting old legends 
              to verses of his own. Scott argued that the ballad was, by definition, 
              a fluid form, to which each interpreter gave his or her own stamp. 
              He insisted that he was always faithful to the spirit of a ballad, 
              and valued readability over antiquarian exactitude. Scott was also 
              careful not to deal too rude a shock to the aesthetic sensibilities 
              of readers brought up on neoclassical verse.</p>            
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="58%">Scott originally intended to concentrate on ballads celebrating
                  historical incidents, particularly those connected with the
                  old Border raids, but the first two-volume edition of the <i>Minstrelsy</i>,
                  which appeared on February 24, 1802, eventually contained twenty-nine
                  historical pieces and twenty-four romantic ballads, together
                  with a handful of 'imitations' mostly by Scott himself (see <a href="../../biography/poet.html#minstrelsy">Scott
                  the Poet</a> for further information). Almost immediately after
                  publication, Scott set about preparing a third volume which
                  would be comprised entirely of modern imitations of traditional
                  ballad forms. Contributors included Matthew Lewis, Charles
                  Kirkpatrick Sharpe (portrayed, right), Anna Seward, and Scott
                  himself. Among the pieces that Scott originally intended for
                  the third volume was a tale of Border rivalry which rapidly
                  grew too long for the <i>Minstrelsy</i> and would eventually
                  appear as Scott's first verse narrative <a href="minstrel.html"><i>The
                Lay of the Last Minstrel</i></a>. </td>
                <td width="42%"><img src="graphics/cc0806.jpg" alt="Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, lithograph by W.H. McFarlane after D.O. Hill (Corson P.1273)" width="260" height="250" hspace="10" align="right"></td>
              </tr>
            </table>            
            <p>Along with the third volume, Scott also began preparing a second 
              edition of the first two which would include further traditional 
              ballads gathered on his own travels or sent to him by fellow antiquaries. 
              While ballad-hunting to this purpose in Selkirkshire in April 1802, 
              Scott made the acquaintance of the young farmer, William Laidlaw, 
              later to become a valued member of the <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> 
              'family'. Laidlaw showed Scott a copy of 'Auld Maitland', a ballad
              Scott had heard of but so far never seen. Laidlaw had been given
              the copy by one of his shepherds, James
              Hogg, whom Scott visited shortly afterwards, the beginning of 
              an important literary friendship. On May 25, 1803, the second edition 
              of the <i>Minstrelsy</i> was published, comprising revised versions 
              of vols. I-II along with the 'modern' third volume. A third, expanded 
              edition appeared in 1806, a fourth in 1810 (containing, for all 
              Scott's feel for authenticity, three forgeries by Surtees), and 
              the fifth and final edition in 1812, containing ninety-six ballads, 
              forty-three printed for the first time.</p>

            <h3 align="left"><font color="#003366"><a name="reception" id="reception"></a>Reception</font></h3>            <p>The <i>Minstrelsy</i> sold well on both sides of the border, and 
              the first edition was exhausted in six months. German, Danish, and 
              Swedish translations followed, and North American editions gave 
              Scott his first taste of transatlantic fame. The volume's success 
              laid the foundations of James Ballantyne's career as a printer. 
              'I shall ever think', he wrote, 'the printing the <i>Scottish Minstrelsy</i> 
              one of the most fortunate circumstances of my life' (letter to Scott, 
              March 30, 1802).</p>
            <p>Critical response was highly favourable too, though not all reviewers 
              were impressed by the modern imitations. The one negative notice 
              was published by the <i>Monthly Review</i>, but even this complimented 
              Scott on his 'fidelity, taste, and learning'.</p>
            <p>For all the reservations that have subsequently been expressed 
              concerning Scott's editorial principles, his skill and commitment 
              as a collector is beyond doubt. The<i> Minstrelsy</i>, over its 
              various editions, contains almost a quarter of the known corpus 
              of ancient Scottish ballads. </p>
