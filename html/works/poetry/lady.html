			<p><img src="../../graphics/lady.jpg" alt="Ellen Douglas, 1811, engraved by Charles Heath after Richard Westall (Corson H.WES.4)" width="195" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">Scott began writing<i> The Lady of the Lake</i> in August 1809 while holidaying
			  with his wife, <a href="../../biography/marriage.html">Charlotte</a>, and
			  daughter, Sofia, in the Trossachs and along the shores and islands of Loch
			  Katrine, the very scenes that would provide the poem's setting. With this
			  new poem, though, Scott wished to depend less on local colour and spectacular
			  action and to attain greater psychological depth in his characterization.
			  As he worked on the poem, Scott felt that, in this respect, it would only
			  be a partial success. While he was confident that he had brought King James
			  V and the clan chieftain Roderick Dhu vividly to life, he feared that the
			  romantic hero, Malcolm Graeme would remain 'a perfect automaton' (letter
			  to Lady Abercorn, March 14, 1810). Although initial progress on the poem
			  was rapid, work was delayed when his children Walter, Charles, and Anne
			  fell dangerously ill with an inflammatory fever. Only when they had fully
			  recovered was he able to complete the poem which was published on May 8,
			  1810. </p>

			<p><img src="graphics/cc0011.jpg" alt="Heraldic watercolour by T. Willement (Corson P.4807)" width="160" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">The narrative of the poem concerns the struggle between King James 
              V and the powerful clan Douglas. The King has banished the entire 
              family from his realm, including James of Douglas, the Earl of Bothwell, 
              who had been his protector during his youth. The Earl and his daughter 
              Ellen take refuge with Roderick Dhu in his castle on an island in 
              Loch Katrine. At the beginning of the poem a mysterious knight calling 
              himself James Fitz-James arrives at the castle and is granted hospitality. 
              During his brief stay, he falls in love with Ellen but finds rivals 
              for her affections in Roderick himself and in Malcolm Graeme, a 
              young knight loyal to the King but moved by sympathy at the plight 
              of Douglases. It is Malcolm that Ellen favours. Facing attack from 
              royal forces for sheltering Douglas, Roderick gathers his clan. 
              Douglas, though, is loath to bring disaster upon his host, and sets 
              out for the royal court at Stirling, determined to surrender. Fitz-James 
              returns and offers to take Ellen to safety but is told that she 
              loves another. He nonetheless presses on her a ring which, he says, 
              will obtain any favour from the King. Travelling to Stirling, Fitz-James 
              meets and quarrels with Roderick. In the ensuing fight, Roderick 
              is mortally wounded and carried to Stirling as a captive. Ellen 
              presents herself at court and, showing the ring, pleads for her 
              father's pardon. She discovers that Fitz-James is no other than 
              the King himself. The King and Douglas are reconciled through her 
              intervention, and Ellen and Malcolm marry. </p>

			<p><i>The Lady of the Lake</i> marked the pinnacle of Scott's popularity 
              as a poet. With 25,000 copies sold in eight months, it broke all 
              records for the sale of poetry, and Scott's fame spread beyond Great 
              Britain to the United States. The critics almost matched the enthusiasm 
              of the public. In the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, the habitually glacial 
              Francis Jeffrey felt it far exceeded its predecessors: the story 
              was 'constructed with infinitely more skill and address' and there 
              was 'a larger variety of characters, more artfully and judiciously 
              contrasted'. For the <i>British Critic</i>, the story itself was 
              more interesting than in Scot's earlier poems, but the poem's real 
              charm lay in 'painting real manners; and displaying the character 
              of an interesting because singular people'. Reservations were expressed 
              by the <i>Critical Review</i> which thought Canto III superfluous 
              and by the Rev. Francis Hodgson in the <i>Monthly Review</i>, for 
              whom the composition careless and the language barbaric. The public, 
              though, continued to devour the poem. Sightseers flocked to Loch 
              Katrine, and a hotel was built at Callander catering for those who 
              wished to visit 'Ellen's Isle'. <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> created 
              a vogue for the Trossachs and is primarily responsible for the area's 
              enduring popularity with tourists.</p>
