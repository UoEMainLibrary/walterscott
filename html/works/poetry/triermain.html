              still hard at work on <a href="rokeby.html"><i>Rokeby</i></a>. It 
              was a continuation of one of three anonymous fragments that he had 
              printed in the <i>Edinburgh Annual Register</i> for 1809. Scott 
              had been amused by the conjectures surrounding their authorship 
              and thought it would be diverting to play a further hoax on the 
              reviewers by publishing a lengthier anonymous composition. He particularly 
              relished bamboozling the influential William Jeffrey, whom he thought 
              lacking in true poetic sensibility. Many critics had believed Scott's 
              friend William Erskine to be the author of the lines in the <i>Register</i>, 
              and now Erskine agreed to play along with Scott's scheme, submitting 
              a learned preface. Scott himself inserted allusions in the text 
              of the poem designed to remind the reader of Erskine. He had hoped 
              to mystify the critics further by publishing <i>The Bridal of Triermain</i> 
              simultaneously with <i>Rokeby</i>. In the event, though, it did 
              not appear until almost two months later on March 9, 1813. </p>

            <p><i>The Bridal of Triermain</i> interweaves three stories, all with 
              a Lake District setting: the eighteenth-century courtship of Arthur 
              and Lucy, the Arthurian Legend of 'Lyulph's Tale', and the twelfth-century 
              romance of Sir Roland de Vaux.</p>
            <p>In order to warn his aristocratic lover Lucy against excessive 
              maidenly pride, the low-born poet Arthur recites 'Lyulph's Tale' 
              in cantos I-II. He tells how how King Arthur is seduced by the enchantress 
              Guendolen. When he abandons the pregnant Guendolen to resume his 
              kingly duties, she swears revenge. Sixteen years later, the fruit 
              of their union, Gyneth appears at Camelot to remind Arthur of his 
              promise that should he and Guendolen produce a daughter, she would 
              wed the bravest of the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur declares 
              a tournament with Gyneth's hand as the prize but instructs her to 
              halt the combat before lives are lost. As the instrument of her 
              mother's wrath, however, she does nothing to end the ferocious fighting, 
              until Merlin arises from a chasm in the ground to punish her. She 
              is sentenced to slumber in Guendolen's enchanted castle until awakened 
              by a knight as brave as any of the Round Table.</p>
            <p>The poet Arthur's courtship of Lucy proves successful and, following 
              their marriage, Lucy begs him to tell of Gyneth's fate. In the third 
              and final canto, then, he recounts the quest of the twelfth-century 
              knight Sir Roland de Vaux of Triermain. He has heard Gyneth's legend 
              and sets out to find the enchanted castle. Having located it in 
              the Valley of Saint John, he successfully passes through a series 
              of allegorical dangers and temptations (Fear, Avarice, Sensuality, 
              Ambition) to awaken Gyneth from her five hundred-year sleep and 
              win her hand.</p>

                <td width="72%">Published anonymously, <i>The Bridal of Triermain</i> fooled
                  almost all readers. The <i>Critical Review</i> was typical
                  in declaring it 'one of the prettiest poems to which the fashion
                  of imitating Walter Scott has given birth'. Although Jeffrey
                  published no review, Scott was particularly gratified to hear
                  at second-hand that Jeffrey considered it more attentive to
                  style and elegance than his own work. Similarly, George Ellis,
                  writing in the <i>Quarterly</i>, felt that, although 'inferior
                  in vigour' to some of Scott's work, it equalled or surpassed
                  it 'in elegance and beauty'. Although subsequent critics have
                  largely continued to treat <i>The Bridal of Triermain</i> as
                  a skillful pastiche, some commentators have suggested that
                  it contains a highly personal network of allusions. In particular,
                  Una Pope-Hennessy, in her <i>Laird of Abbotsford</i>, sees
                  Arthur's courtship of Lucy as mirroring Scott's own meeting
                  with his wife <a href="../../biography/marriage.html">Charlotte
                  Carpenter</a> at Gilsland Spa in Cumberland in 1797, and their
                  excursions around the Lake District, including to Triermain
                Castle itself.</td>

            </table>            <p>The <i>Bridal</i> sold well, but neither it nor <i>Rokeby</i> were 
              the commercial triumph that Scott required to cover his mounting 
              expenses at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> 
              and to mend the increasingly perilous affairs of <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John
