			    <td><i>The Lord of the Isles</i> started life in 1811 as Scott was looking
			      for a potentially lucrative poetical subject to cover the cost of building
			      his new home at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>.
			      He initially felt that a poem on the wanderings of Robert the Bruce
			      would meet his purpose. Shortly after setting to work on it, however,
			      he thought that an English theme might have more 'novelty' and abandoned
			      it in favour of <a href="rokeby.html"><i>Rokeby</i></a>. He took up
			      the Bruce manuscript once again in 1813, when seeking funds after the
			      collapse of <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John Ballantyne</a>'s
			      publishing house (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html">Financial
			      Hardship</a>). After lengthy negotiations, the rights to the poem were
		      sold in advance to John Constable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td>

			<p>In the summer and autumn of 1814, Scott was invited to join a party 
              of Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouse Service on a voyage 
              of inspection around the coast of Scotland and through its various 
              islands. The party included Scott's old friend William Erskine, 
              Sheriff of Orkney and Zetland (Shetland), and the lighthouse builder, 
              Robert Stevenson, grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson. Scott hoped 
              that the voyage would permit him to refresh his memories of the 
              Western Isles (which he had first visited in 1810) and to discover 
              locations which might be used in the poem. The Orkney and Shetland 
              leg of the voyage would subsequently provide source material for 
              his 1821 novel <i><a href="../novels/pirate.html">The Pirate</a></i>.</p>
			<p>He began writing upon his return to Abbotsford, vividly working 
              his fresh impressions of Skye, Staffa, Arran, and Mull into his 
              verse. <i>The Lord of the Isles</i> was composed at a feverish rate, 
              with the first three cantos being complete by November 10 and the 
              remaining three by December 16. The completed poem was published 
              on January 2, 1815 and after a worryingly slow start, the first 
              edition sold out within a month. </p>

			    <td width="62%">The story opens in the castle of Ardtornish in 1307 on the wedding-day
			      of Edith of Lorn and Ronald, Lord of the Isles. A tense atmosphere reigns
			      as Edith rightly suspects that Ronald is a reluctant groom. Indeed,
			      he has fallen in love with the Bruce's sister, Isabel. Before the marriage
			      is celebrated, the fugitive Bruce arrives and, concealing his identity,
			      demands sanctuary. His party includes his brother Edward and Isabel,
			      her face hidden by a veil. Edith's brother, the Lord of Lorn recognizes
			      the Bruce and denounces him as the murderer of his kinsman the Red Comyn
			      in Greyfriars Church, Dumfries. As their quarrel threatens to become
			      violent, Isabel throws off her veil and attempts to intercede. Ronald's
			      reaction reveals to Edith where his affections lie. The Abbot who is
			      to conduct the ceremony arrives and is asked to decide the conflict
			      between the Bruce and the Lord of Lorn. The Abbot strives to denounce
			      the Bruce's sacrilegious crime but is moved by divine inspiration to
			      acclaim him as the future liberator of Scotland. Ronald pledges fealty
		      to the Bruce, but Edith and her brother Lorn leave in fury.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td>

			  Edith to a convent. On Skye, the royal party meet five piratical
			  followers of Lorn who claim to have been shipwrecked there. They
			  have with them a
			  captive, a mute minstrel-boy whom neither Ronald nor the Bruce
			  recognizes as Edith in disguise. In the night the followers of

			<p>The Bruce's brother Edward arrives with news that Scotland has risen against
			  English rule and that Edward I of England is dead. The Bruce proceeds to
			  Arran where his fleet his awaiting him. During the voyage, Ronald asks the
			  Bruce for Isabel's hand. The Bruce promises to urge his suit but at Arran,
			  in the Convent of St Bride, he learns that Isabel desires to be a nun. In
			  all events, she could not marry Ronald until he has been absolved from his
			  promise to marry Edith.</p>
			<p>Edith, still disguised as a minstrel, is sent with a message to 
                one of the Bruce's followers at Carrick. She is captured by the
			  English at Turnberry Castle, the Bruce's ancestral home, and condemned
                to death as a spy. Her life is saved, though, when the Bruce
			  successfully storms the castle. The siege proves to be the turning-point
			  in the
                Bruce's fortunes, and he goes on to regain almost all of Scotland. </p>
			<p>The poem ends with his final victory at Bannockburn. In the intervening 
              years, the Bruce has reluctantly consented to his sister taking 
              conventual vows. Edith has joined Isabel in the convent without 
              herself taking vows. Ronald, meanwhile, has grown increasingly remorseful 
              at his faithlessness to Edith. Isabel recommends that she go to 
              Ronald in disguise and test the extent of his penitence. She confronts 
              him on the victorious field of Bannockburn. Ronald begs for her 
              forgiveness and their engagement is renewed.</p>

			<p>Reviews were mixed. Some journals (<i>British Review</i>, <i>European 
              Magazine</i>, <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, 
              <i>Scot's Magazine</i>) ranked <i>The Lord of the Isles</i> amongst 
              Scott's best work. For others, though, it showed signs of hurried 
              composition. The <i>Augustan Review</i> wished that Scott would 
              'think more, print less'. The <i>Eclectic Review</i> found the dialogue 
              prolix and prosaic, the diction careless, and the rhymes and imagery 
              often inappropriate. George Ellis in a particularly detailed review 
              for the <i>Quarterly </i>regretted 'violations of propriety' in 
              both language and plot. He felt there was no genuine, vital connection 
              between the amours of Ronald and Edith and the Bruce's campaigns, 
              and, like many readers, found the lovers' reconciliation inadequately 
              motivated.</p>
			<p>Although sales were respectable after a slow start, they did not 
              match those of <i><a href="marmion.html">Marmion</a></i> and the 
              <i> <a href="lady.html">Lady of the Lake</a></i>. It became evident 
              to Scott that his vogue as a poet was waning and that he could not 
              hope to rival the popularity of Byron. Increasingly, his hopes were 
              invested in his embryonic work as a novelist.</p>
