            <p><img src="graphics/cc16.gif" alt="Symbols of the English Civil War, watercolour by Thomas Willement, 1825 (Corson P.4807)" width="231" height="184" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">In
              December 1811, having agreed to the young architect William Stark's
              ambitious but exorbitantly priced plan for his new 'cottage' at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>,
              Scott began looking for a lucrative poetic topic to cover his coming
              expenses. He first contemplated, and indeed began work on, a poem
              on Robert the Bruce but felt that an English subject would be more
              novel. He soon thought of setting the poem during the English Civil
              War and locating its action at Rokeby Park in County Durham, the
              home of his friend John Morritt, which he had visited in June 1809.
              Morritt was only too happy to supply further local and historical
              information, and Scott was to refresh his impressions during a
              further visit in September 1812.</p>
            <p>Progress on the poem was initially slow. Scott was unhappy with
              the first draft of the opening canto and destroyed it in March
              1812. Work was then held up by his family's flitting to Abbotsford
              in May and by the emerging financial difficulties of <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John
              Ballantyne and Co.</a>, in which Scott was a silent half-partner
              (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html">Financial hardship</a>).
              Scott threw the entire manuscript into the fire in September 1812
              and started over again. The third draft proceeded much more rapidly
              and Scott was hopeful of publishing by Christmas. He began, however,
              to work simultaneously on a lighter poetic romance, <i><a href="triermain.html">The
              Bridal of Triermain</a></i>. This was to be published anonymously
              at the same as <i>Rokeby</i>, in the hope that the public would
              think it the work of an imitator and rival of Scott. This is the
              first instance of a taste for mystification, which Scott would
              later indulge in as a novelist, appearing variously in the guise
              of 'The Author of <i>Waverley</i>' and Jedediah Cleishbotham. As
              Scott was also seeking to complete his editorial work on <i>The
              Works of Jonathan Swift</i>, he was only able to complete <i>Rokeby</i> on
              December 31, 1812, with the poem appearing on January 11, 1813.</p>

            <p><img src="../../graphics/rokeby.jpg" alt="Rokeby, engraved by Charles Heath after George Cattermole, 1845 (Corson P.1557)" width="250" height="176" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">The
              poem is set just after the Parliamentarian victory at Marston Moor
              (1644). Prior to the outbreak of war, the Royalist Lord Rokeby
              has favoured the marriage of his daughter Matilda (in whom some
              have seen a portrait of <a href="../../biography/marriage.html">Williamina
              Belsches</a>) with Wilfrid Wycliffe. When Wilfrid's father Oswald,
              however, joins the rebels, he withdraws his consent. At Marston
              Moor, Rokeby is consigned as a prisoner to Oswald. Oswald, meanwhile,
              plans to murder a fellow Parliamentarian Philip, of Mortham, whose
              vengeance he fears. In the past, Oswald, having failed to seduce
              Mortham's wife, had deceived Mortham into killing her on suspicion
              of infidelity. Shortly after, Mortham's infant child had been carried
              of by an armed band. In despair, Mortham had turned to piracy,
              accumulating a fortune on the Spanish Main. Oswald hires a disaffected
              retainer, Bertram Risingham, to whom he promises Mortham's treasure.
              Bertram shoots Mortham, and leaves him for dead. He then attacks
              Rokeby Castle where Mortham's treasure is stored, but Rokeby's
              page Redmond O'Neale, a young Irishman, puts up a spirited defence.
              The castle is set alight during the attack, and, through Redmond's
              assistance, Matilda and Wilfrid escape. Redmond and Rokeby, however,
              remain in Oswald's custody. Oswald learns that Mortham is still
              alive and discovers too that Redmond is Mortham's missing son.
              Frustrated in his schemes, he threatens Rokeby and Redmond with
              death, unless the former agree to his daughter's marriage with
              Wilfrid. Matilda consents to save her father's life, but Wilfrid
              refuses to accept her sacrifice, dying soon after of wounds received
              during the attack on Rokeby Castle. Oswald orders the executions
              to proceed but is killed, in the nick of time, by Bertram, who
              has survived the blaze and whose loyalty to Mortham has revived.
              Bertram is in turn killed by Oswald's soldiers. Mortham and Redmond
              are reunited, and Matilda and Redmond wed.</p>

            <p>For any other poet, <i>Rokeby</i> would have been an astounding
              commercial success, with 10,000 copies sold in the first three
              months. At the same stage, however, sales of <a href="lady.html"><i>The
              Lady of the Lake</i></a> had reached 14,000, and <i>Rokeby</i> fell
              far short of being the triumph that Scott had counted on to cover
              his mounting expenses at Abbotsford and to mend the affairs of
              John Ballantyne and Co. </p>
            <p>Critical opinion was broadly favourable, with particularly positive
              reviews appearing in the <i>Antijacobin Review</i>, <i>British
              Critic</i>, and <i>Monthly Review</i>. The <i>British Critic</i>'s
              reviewer called it 'pure poetry' and predicted that 'the name of
              Scott will descend to the latest posterity with those of the most
              established poets'. There was particular praise for the vigour
              and variety of Scott's characterizations, though reservations were
              expressed regarding the coherence of the plot. A harsher view was
              offered by the <i>Literary Panorama</i> which thought Scott's vocabulary
              and rhymes poor and, foreshadowing much criticism of Scott's novels,
              noted many anachronisms in period detail. </p>
            <p>Scott was to return to narrative verse with <i><a href="lord.html">The
                  Lord of the Isles</a></i> and <a href="waterloo.html"><i>The
                  Field of Waterloo</i></a> (both 1815) and <i><a href="harold.html">Harold
                  the Dauntless</a></i> (1817) but was never to repeat the success
                  of <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>.</p>
