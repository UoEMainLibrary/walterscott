                    <p align="left">Scott signed a contract to write a new novel,
                      known almost from the outset as <em>The Antiquary</em>,
                      in January 1815. By Scott's own standards, progress was
                      slow. Contracted to be published by 4 June 1815, the novel
                      did not appear until 4 May 1816. In one of the most active
                      years of Scott's life, a number of other social and literary
                      commitments appear to have intervened. Scott visited London
                      in April 1815 and, in August, took advantage of the re-opening
                      of the Continent by visiting the battlefield of Waterloo
                      and proceeding to Paris through Belgium and occupied France.
                      Two works were inspired by his travels and published by
                      the end of the year: the narrative poem <em><a href="../poetry/waterloo.html">The
                      Field of Waterloo</a></em> and the travelogue <em><a href="../prose/kinsfolk.html">Paul's
                      Letters to His Kinsfolk</a></em>. Scott's private correspondence
                      for 1815 give a sense of constant public activity, ranging
                      from meetings with dignitaries such as the Prince Regent,
                      Wellington, Castlereagh and the Czar of Russia, to putting
                      in bids for more land around <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>. </p>

            <p align="left">By the end of the year, Scott was being pressed by
              his publishers. They had given their tacit blessing to his trip
              to the Continent, anticipating profits from <em>The Field of Waterloo</em> and <em>Paul's
              Letters to His Kinsfolk</em>, which they were happy to see appear
              before <em>The Antiquary</em>. They had, however, paid Scott significant
              advances for the elusive novel, and Constable, in particular, was
              in severe financial difficulty. In a letter of 22 December 1815
              to his friend J.B.S. Morritt, Scott confessed that he was yet to
              begin work on the novel and had produced only 'a very general sketch' <em>(Letters</em>,
              IV, 145). It seemly likely, however, that the plot had already
              been mentally elaborated, as the eventual penning of the novel
              was exceptionally rapid. Scott probably began writing on 30 December
              and had completed <em>The Antiquary</em> by mid-March 1816. </p>
            <p align="left">The action of <em>The Antiquary</em> can be precisely
              dated to July and August 1794, approximately a decade after the
              action of <a href="mannering.html"><i>Guy Mannering</i></a>. In
              Scott's conception, as expressed in the 'Advertisement' at the
              head of the first edition, the novel completed 'a series of fictitious
              narratives, intended to illustrate the manners of Scotland at three
              different periods. WAVERLEY embraced the age of our fathers, GUY
              MANNERING that of our own youth, and the ANTIQUARY refers to the
              last ten years of the eighteenth century'. Scott powerfully evokes
              a nationwide fear of French invasion and Republican insurrection
              as well as the underlying economic confidence of the times. The
              antiquarian Jonathan Oldbuck, who Scott claimed to have based on
              his childhood friend George Constable, is largely a self-portrait.
              In the debates concerning the Roman colonization of Scotland, the
              fantastic Scottish history of Hector Boece, and the authenticity
              of James Macpherson's <em>Poems of Ossian</em>, Scott relives the
              quarrels and enthusiasms of his youth. Oldbuck's unsuccessful courtship
              of Eveline Neville recalls something of Scott's own unhappy experience
              with <a href="../../biography/marriage.html">Williamina Belsches</a>.
              Perhaps because it involved the recollection of scenes of his early
              life, <em>The Antiquary</em> remained Scott's personal favourite
              among his novels. </p>
            <p align="left">The geographical location of the action, conversely,
              is indefinite. Most topographical references point to a composite
              setting somewhere in North-East Scotland. Some sequences, however,
              imply that the narrative takes place on the North Coast, bolstering
              the theory that the swindler Dousterswivel was modelled on the
              German adventurer Rudolf Erich Raspe (author of <em>The Surprising
              Adventures of Baron Munchausen</em>) who tricked Sir John Sinclair
              into a fallacious mining enterprise on his Caithness lands.</p>

            The hero, known as Major Neville, is believed to be the illegitimate
            son of Edward Neville, brother to the Earl of Glenallan. He meets
            and falls in love with Isabella Wardour in England, who, mindful
            of her father's hatred of illegitimacy, rejects his suit. Under the
            assumed name of Lovel, he follows her home to Fairport, Scotland,
            meeting en route Jonathan Oldbuck, Laird of Monkbarns, a neighbour
            of Isabella's father, Sir Arthur Wardour. Oldbuck, the antiquary
            of the title, takes an interest in Lovel who is a sympathetic listener
            to his learned discourses and whose misfortunes in love remind him
            of his own. As a young man Oldbuck had been hopelessly attached to
            Eveline Neville, now wife to the Earl of Glenallan. Lovel saves Sir
            Arthur and Isabella from drowning when surprised by the tide but
            is forced to leave Fairport after wounding Oldbuck's nephew Captain
            Hector M'Intyre, a rival for Isabella's hand, in a duel. In his absence
            Lovel distinguishes himself as a soldier and secretly rescues Sir
            Arthur from the financial ruin to which his reliance on his unscrupulous
            German agent Dousterswivel would have led him. Lovel finally returns
            to Fairport and is unexpectedly revealed to be the son and heir of
            the Earl of Glenallan (and of Oldbuck's unrequited love Eveline).
            In this new guise, he wins Isabella's hand.

            <p align="left">Published in an edition of 6,000 copies on May 4,
              1816,<i> The Antiquary</i> was even more successful than its predecessors,
              sold out within three weeks. It went through a further nine editions
              in Scott's lifetime. It was received with similar critical acclaim
              to <i>Guy Mannering</i>. John Wilson Croker, writing for the <i>Quarterly</i>,
              even thought that the absence of supernatural elements gave <i>The
              Antiquary</i> the edge over <i>Guy Mannering</i>. There was particular
              praise for the character of the beggar Edie Ochiltree who plays
              an important role in bringing the relationship between Lovel and
              Isabella to a happy conclusion. The only new criticism came from <i>The
              British Lady's Magazine</i> which suggested that Scott was merely
              repeating his characters with different names. Most critics, however,
              were pleasantly surprised that the author's creative vein had not
              been exhausted by his previous novels. </p>
