                Heart of Midlothian </i> was
              published as the Second Series of <i>Tales of My Landlord</i> on
              July 25, 1818, seven months after <a href="../novels/robroy.html"><i>Rob
                   Roy</i></a>. Scott had been very satisfied with Constable's
                   handling  of <i>Rob Roy</i> and therefore did not revert to
                   Blackwood and  Murray. Scott also transferred the rights for
                   the first series of 
              <i>Tales of My Landlord </i>(see <i><a href="mortality.html">The
               Tale of Old Mortality</a> </i>and <i><a href="dwarf.html">The
               Black  Dwarf</a></i>) to Constable, beginning with the fifth edition
               of 1819. The novel's heroine, Jeanie Deans, was inspired by
              an account that Scott had received of Helen Walker, who had journeyed
              all the way to London on foot to obtain a pardon for her sister
              on a charge of child-murder. With Scott regaining his health during
              January and February 1818, the tale progressed fast. During May
              1818 Scott was so determined to finish <i>The Heart of Midlothian</i> 
              that he broke his usual habit and worked after dinner as well as
               in the morning. </p>

            <p align="left"><img src="graphics/cc25.gif" alt="Headquarters of the Edinburgh City Guards, pencil drawing by James Skene (Corson MSS)" width="169" height="209" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The first volume of the novel, opening in Edinburgh
              in 1736, is  dominated by the Porteous Riots. A condemned criminal
              Andrew Wilson
      has helped his accomplice 'Robertson' (the assumed identity of the
                reckless young nobleman George Staunton) to escape. Won over
              by this selfless act, the crowd are incensed when Captain Porteous,
                the soldier presiding over Wilson's hanging, treats him with
              great
      brutality. At their protest, Porteous fires into the crowd, killing
                half-a-dozen people. Porteous is subsequently condemned for murder
      but reprieved at the last minute. A mob, led by Staunton, storm
                the Old Tolbooth Prison (known as 'The Heart of Midlothian'),
              seize Porteous and lynch him. Staunton had also hoped to liberate
              his
                lover Effie Deans who is awaiting trial for child-murder, but
              she refuses to escape. The second volume is concerned with her
              trial
                and condemnation. Having been seduced and made pregnant by Staunton,
      Effie has hidden her condition from her sister, father, and employers.
                Since she cannot produce the child in court and has informed
              nobody of her condition, it is presumed that she has murdered her
              child
                to conceal her guilt. The truth is that the baby has been stolen
      by Staunton's demented former mistress Madge Wildfire while Effie
                lay sick. Effie's sister Jeanie faces a moral dilemma in court
      when asked whether Effie told her of her condition. Although a white
                lie would save Effie's life, Jeanie's religious and moral convictions
      forbid her to tell an untruth. Effie is sentenced to death. Volume
                III covers Jeanie's journey to London in the course of which
              she meets both Madge Wildfire and her mother Meg Murdockson who
              has
                sold Effie's son to a vagrant woman in revenge for Staunton's
              seducing her daughter. In London Jeanie is aided by the Duke of
              Argyle, who
                manages to secure her a successful interview with the Queen.
              The final volume describes Jeanie's marriage to the Presbyterian
              minister
                Reuben Butler and their newfound prosperity living on the estate
      of the Duke of Argyle. Effie, meanwhile, marries Staunton. Many
                years later Staunton, while searching for his lost child, is
              killed by an outlaw who turns out to be his own son. The son then
              flees
            to America and joins an Indian tribe.</p>

            <p align="left">Many now consider <i>The Heart of Midlothian</i> to 
              be the best of the Waverley novels. On first publication, however, 
              despite its immediate commercial succes, critical reaction was lukewarm. 
              Criticism centred on the fourth volume which was felt to protract 
              the novel beyond its natural conclusion. <i>Blackwood's</i> and 
              the <i>British Review</i> suggested that it had been tagged on with 
              profit in mind. The <i>Monthly Review</i> argued that Effie's transformation 
              into Lady Staunton and Staunton's death at the hands were excessively 
              improbable. All nonetheless praised Scott for his ability to recreate 
              the past vividly and to illustrate the Scottish character. </p>
