			  the first work of fiction to which Scott put his own name. Although the
			  title page credits the
			  <em>Chronicles</em> to the 'Author of Waverley', an autobiographical introduction
			  is signed 'Walter Scott'. Comprised of two short stories <a href="widow.html">'The
			  Highland Widow</a>' and <a href="drovers.html">'The Two Drovers'</a> and
			  a novella <a href="daughter.html">'The Surgeon's Daughter'</a>, this is
			  Scott's only collection of shorter fiction. Each story is set in
			  the second half of the eighteenth century and deals with the exodus
			  of Scots from their post-Union,
			        post-Culloden
			        homeland to seek fortune elsewhere. A linking narrative is
			  provided by 'Chrystal Croftangry', a resident in the Canongate,
			        Edinburgh, who writes up the tales from the recollections
			  of his friends, Mrs Bethune Baliol and Miss Kate Fairscribe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
			<p>The <em>Chronicles</em> were Scott's first experiments in fiction since
			  the <a href="../../biography/finance.html#1826">financial
			    crash</a> of 1825-26. When Scott first proposed the new publication in
			    May 1826, he was living in reduced circumstances and was short
			    of money for personal expenses. He had been forced to sell his
			    house in Castle Street (see <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Homes</a>)
			    and to seek rented lodgings. <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford
			    House</a> was beyond his
			    creditors' grasp, as it had been secured to his son Walter on
			    his marriage in 1825, but the estate had been sequestrated.
			    Scott was particularly in need of ready cash to fit out his
			    nephew, another Walter, for a voyage to India, where he was sailing
			    as an army engineer.</p>
			<p>On 12 May 1826, <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James Ballantyne</a> approached
			  Robert Cadell on Scott's behalf to propose the publication of an
			  'Eastern tale'. Cadell, Archibald Constable's former partner, had
			  just set up in business under his own name and eagerly grasped
			  the opportunity to launch his list with a work by the best-selling
			  'Author of Waverley'.
			  Cadell proposed that the tale appear in two volumes, a ploy to
			  prevent Constable's trustees from claiming the profits from the
			  publication in order to pay their own creditors.
			  In a desperate attempt to avoid financial ruin, Constable
			  had offered as surety three unfinished works by Scott: <em><a href="cavalier.html">Woodstock</a></em>,
			  <a href="../prose/napoleon.html"><em>The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte</em></a> and
			  an unnamed novel. It was not until July 1827 that a court ruling
			  determined that the trustees
			  of James Ballantyne and Co. rather than those of Archibald Constable
			  and Co. should benefit from these three publications and subsequent
			  works by Scott. For the moment Scott feared that a three-volume
			  work (the standard format for a novel) would be seized upon as
			  the unnamed novel. Indeed, he was initially reluctant even to sign
			  the work as the 'Author of Waverley' until he realized that that
			  anonymity would damage sales.</p>
			<p>A further reason for turning to shorter fiction rather than a new novel
			  was that Scott could more easily work on it in tandem with <a href="../prose/napoleon.html"><em>The
			  Life of Napoleon Buonaparte</em></a>. There were many intervals in the composition
			  of Scott's massive biography of the French Emperor as he was
			  forced to wait for essential source material. These he filled with
			  work on the <em>Chronicles</em>. The short story was only just beginning
			  to emerge as a popular literary genre in the 1820s. Scott, however,
			  had already demonstrated his mastery of the form in 'Wandering
			  Willie's Tale', a narrative embedded in his 1824 novel <a href="redgaun.html"><em>Redgauntlet</em></a>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Chronicles</em> took longer to compose than any of Scott's earlier
			  works of fiction except <a href="waverley.html"><em>Waverley</em></a>. The
			  composition is unusually well-documented, and has been expertly
			  pieced together by Claire Lamont, editor of the recent <a href="../../publications/editions.html#canongate">Edinburgh
			  Edition</a> of the <em>Chronicles</em> (2000), to which the following account
			  is greatly indebted. In addition to the surviving manuscript and
			    correspondence between Scott, Ballantyne, and Cadell, Dr Lamont
			    was able to draw
			    on three new sources: Scott's
			    <em>Journal</em> (begun in 1825), the meticulously-kept records of Robert
			    Cadell, and those of Scott's and Ballantyne's
		    Trustees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
			<p><img src="graphics/cc0982.jpg" alt="Canongate Cross, Edinburgh, engraved by Owen Jones after William Douglas, 185-? (Corson P.550)" width="175" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Three
			  days after Ballantyne proposed the <em>Chronicles</em> to Cadell,
			  Scott's wife Charlotte died after a lengthy illness. On May 27,
			  a mere five days after the funeral, Scott threw himself
			  into work, turning not to the promised 'Oriental tale' but to 'The
			  Highland Widow'. He began with a description of Mrs Martha Bethune
			  Balliol, the fictional source of a tale which, in fact, Scott had
			  first heard from a family friend Mrs Anne Murray Keith. (For more
			  information on sources, see <a href="widow.html">'The Highland Widow'</a>).
			  The composition was interrupted on 1 June when Scott resumed work
			  on <em>The
			  Life of Napoleon Buonaparte</em>.
			  When Scott returned to the <em>Chronicles</em> on 18 June, it was to flesh
			  out the narrative framework for the collection, introducing the
			  fictional editor Chrystal Croftangry and his circle of friends
			  in Edinburgh's Canongate. By 9 July 1826 he had completed the Croftangry
			  narrative and had begun work on 'The Highland Widow' proper. He
			  and Cadell had also finalized the title for the collection (abandoning
			  the earlier working titles <em>Baliol's Lodgings</em> and <em>The
			  Canongate Chronicle</em>). </p>
			<p>There followed, however, a year-long gap in the
			    composition of the <em>Chronicles</em>, as Scott concentrated exclusively
			    on his<em> Napoleon</em>. Work on the biography took a good deal longer
			    than Scott had anticipated, and necessitated research trips to
		    London and Paris between 12 October and 25 November 1826. Having
			    originally planned to publish the <em>Chronicles</em> in November 1826,
			    Cadell gradually realized that it would not appear until after <em>Napoleon</em>,
			    and put the publication date back to November 1827. Cadell grew
			    increasingly frustrated over the non-appearance of a book destined
			    to launch him as a publisher, but was partly appeased when Scott's
			    Trustees appointed him as Edinburgh
			    publisher of <em>Napoleon</em>.</p>
			<p align="left">Scott finally finished writing <em>Napoleon</em> on 7 May
			  1827 but almost immediately began work on <a href="../prose/grandfather.html"><em>Tales
			  of a Grandfather</em></a>,
			  a history of Scotland for children. Only on 20 June did he at last
			  return to <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>, making a start on 'The Surgeon's
			  Daughter' and completing 'The Highland Widow' by 25 June.			  A few
			  months previously an unexpected event had taken place which would
			  now influence the
			  development of the <em>Chronicles</em>. In February 1827, Scott had been
			  surprised into acknowledging his
			  authorship of the Waverley Novels before a large gathering
			    at a Theatrical
			    Fund Dinner. In truth, the secret had been untenable 
			    since the financial crash of
			  1825-26 which had exposed the extent of Scott's business engagements
			  with James Ballantyne and Archibald Constable. Scott now decided
			  to extend the confession to his worldwide readership by means of
		  a signed preface to the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <em>Chronicles.</em></p>
			<p align="left">The preface was complete by 27 June, and Scott set to work
			  on the second episode of the <em>Chronicles</em>, 'The Two Drovers'.	He
			  made rapid progress and had brought the tale to a conclusion by
			  15 July. Immediately after, he plunged back into <em>Tales of a Grandfather</em>,
			  finishing the first volume on 26 July. The speed with which Scott
			  worked during this period was extraordinary. In the two and a half
			  years after he begun <i>Napoleon</i>, he wrote almost 1.5 million words. </p>
		  <p align="left">Scott
			    now finally turned his attention to 'The Surgeon's Daughter'.
			  The 'eastern tale', the
			    first to be announced, was the last to be written. Scott worked
			    steadily until 22 August when he began to feel the need for first-hand
			    information on Indian phrases and localities. He longed to talk
			    to his neighbour Colonel James Fergusson, an Indian veteran,
			  but he was away. Scott had to wait until the beginning of September
			    for the colonel to return and supply the needed local colour.</p>

			<h3><font color="#003366"><a name="crit"></a>Reception</font></h3>
			<p>The <em>Chronicles</em> were largely well received by reviewers. There
			  was general pleasure at the appearance of a new work of fiction
			  by Scott after
			  the unusually long gap of eighteen months since <em>Woodstock</em>. There
			  was widespread approval too of Scott's decision to return to his
			  home-ground of Scotland for his subject matter. 'The Highland Widow'
			  was widely considered the strongest piece in the collections. 'The
			  Surgeon's Daughter', however, came in for robust criticism. The
			  <em>New Monthly Magazine</em> was particularly harsh, judging that 'the
			  extravagancies are gross and daring' and lamenting that the d&eacute;nouement was
			  'just that
			    of a hundred ballets and melodrames'. Despite critical plaudits,
			  and the interest awakened by the signed preface, sales were disappointing
			  and Cadell would reject Scott's subsequent proposal of a further
			  volume of short fiction.</p>
