              first galley proofs of <i>Peveril of the Peak</i> were already
              rolling off the presses, when <a href="nigel.html"><i>The Fortunes
              of Nigel</i></a> was published in May 1822. Having made rapid early
              progress, Scott had to suspend work on the novel while engaged
              in organizing George IV's visit to Edinburgh in August 1822, the
              first visit to Scotland by a Hanoverian monarch. Exhausted by his
              labours and deeply saddened by the death of his friend William
              Erskine, he found completing the novel a chore. Scott shared <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
              Ballantyne</a>'s view that the story dragged, and only financial
              considerations induced him to persevere. However, towards the end
              of the third volume Scott felt that his inspiration was returning,
              and he decided to write a fourth volume despite protests from Ballantyne.
              Constable was not pleased either, as four volumes would be a costly
              enterprise. By the time Scott had completed <i>Peveril of the Peak</i> and
              it had been published on January 7, 1823, he had tired of it 'most
              damnably' (letter to John Morrit, 11 January 1823).</p>

            <p align="left">The background to the novel is the so-called Popish
              Plot of 1678, when Jesuits were alleged to be planning the assassination
              of King Charles II in order to bring his Roman Catholic brother,
              the Duke of York (later King James II) to the throne. The story
              centres on two Derbyshire landowners, Sir Geoffrey Peveril, an
              old Cavalier, and, Major Ralph Bridgenorth, a Puritan. Despite
              their differing political and religious opinions, they have been
              brought together through events connected with the Civil War. Sir
              Geoffrey's son Julian and Bridgenorth's daughter Alice are secretly
              in love, but their relationship is jeopardized when the Popish
              Plot divides their fathers. Bridgenorth is suspicious of Sir Geoffrey's
              friendship with the Countess of Derby, who, although guiltless,
              is implicated in the Plot. Julian, who has spent some time attached
              to the Countess's household on the Isle of Man, returns to England
              on her service, and finds that Bridgenorth has arrested his father
              as a Papist conspirator. He is himself arrested when trying to
              liberate him but is freed by his father's retainers. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Alice has been entrusted by Bridgenorth to the care
              of his brother-in-law Edward Christian. Christian hatches a plot
              to make Alice the King's mistress and thus gain access to the royal
              ear. His aim is to avenge himself on the Countess of Derby who
              has had his brother executed during the Civil War. To this end,
              he has also placed Fenella, his daughter by a Moorish woman, as
              a spy in the Countess's household. Fenella has long played the
              role of a deaf mute in order to learn her employer's secrets but
              falls in love with Julian during his residence with the Countess.
              She helps Julian rescue Alice from the King's licentious favourite,
              Buckingham. The vengeful Buckingham contrives to have Julian arrested
              under suspicion of involvement in the Popish Plot and imprisoned
              along with his father in the Tower of London. They are put on trial
              but acquitted thanks to the intervention of the King, whom Fenella
              has informed of Christian's conspiracy, and who feels indebted
              to Sir Geoffrey. The King prevails upon Sir Geoffrey and Bridgenorth
              to set aside their differences, and consent to their children's
              marriage.</p>

            <p align="left">As with <a href="nigel.html"><i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i>,</a><i> </i>the
              reviewers were divided over <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>. The <i>Edinburgh
              Magazine</i> and <i>British Critic</i> were altogether favourable,
              the latter declaring that it was 'better calculated to stand the
              test of criticism' than any other Waverley novel. Other journals,
              though, such as the <i>European Magazine</i> and <i>Monthly Review</i> felt
              it was marred by careless composition and excessive padding. The
              plot (as the synopsis above might suggest!) was widely felt to
              be muddled and confused. Some critics were more forthright in their
              censure, the <i>New European Magazine</i> deeming it 'superlatively
              bad' and accusing Scott of profanity and indelicacy, while the <i>Literary
              Chronicle</i> opined that Scott was now writing less for fame than
              fortune. The selling price of the four volumes, two guineas, was
              widely criticized as extortionate. This did not, though, prevent
              it matching the commercial success of its predecessors.</p>
