			<p><i><img src="graphics/cc85.gif" alt="" width="173" height="252" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Ivanhoe</i> was
			  the first novel in which  Scott adopted a purely English subject, portraying
			  the enmity
			  of Saxons and Normans during the reign of Richard I (1189-99).
			  Various explanations have been offered for Scott's decision to
			  turn to medieval England. J. G. Lockhart in his <em>Memoirs of
			  the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> (1837-38) suggests that it may
			  have been sparked by the 'after-dinner conversation' of his friend
			  William Clerk which first drew Scott's attention to racial tensions
			  in post-Norman Conquest England. Clerk noted how our names for
			  livestock generally have Anglo-Saxon origins 
			    (e.g. sheep, pig, cow) which are exchanged for Anglo-French terms
			  once they are prepared for the table (e.g. mutton,
			  pork, beef). This illustration of the subservience of labouring
			  Saxon to land-owning Norman was subsequently inserted in <em>Ivanhoe</em>.
			  For Graham Tulloch, editor of the recent Edinburgh Edition of 
			  the novel<em> </em>(1998),
			  Clerk's observation may have combined with a childhood memory of
			  seeing Saxons and Normans aligned at opposite sides of the stage
			  in John Logan's play <em>Runnamede</em> (1784). It has also been suggested
			  that Scott wished to give fictional form to
			  the ideas explored in his 'Essay on Chivalry' (1818), to seek an
			  English historical equivalent of the feudal clan-based society
			  that he had portrayed in <a href="waverley.html"><em>Waverley</em></a>, <a href="robroy.html"><em>Rob
			    Roy</em></a>, and <a href="montrose.html"><em>A
			    Legend of Montrose</em></a>, or
			    to take up Joanna Baillie's suggestion that he devote a novel
			    to the persecution of witches. The Middle Ages may, moreover,
			    have been particularly present in Scott's mind, as he was acquiring
			    antique weapons for the 'armoury' at                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>. </p>
			<p>Whatever first drew Scott to King Richard's England, it is clear that,
			  first and foremost, he wished to start afresh, abandoning subject-matter
			  of which he feared the public would rapidly tire. It was Scott's
			  original desire that the novel appear without any indication of
			  authorship. He was curious to see whether the public would recognize
			  the 'author
			  of Waverley' behind the assumed narrative persona of
			  Lawrence Templeton. He even hoped to publish <em>Ivanhoe</em> and his next
			  novel <em><a href="monastery.html">The Monastery</a></em> in tandem, thus effectively entering into competition
			  with himself. He was ultimately prevailed upon to drop the plan
			  by Archibald Constable, who feared that the two novels would harm
			  each other's sales, especially given that a spurious Fourth Series
			  of <em>Tales
			  of My Landlord</em> would shortly be published.</p>

			    gallstones-related illness which had plagued him while writing <a href="lammermoor.html"><em>The
			    Bride of Lammermoor</em></a> and <em>A
			    Legend of Montrose</em>. Although Scott had only finished writing <em>A
			    Legend of Montrose</em> at the beginning of June 1819, <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John
			    Ballantyne</a> records
			    the signing of the contract for <em>Ivanhoe</em> in his journal for the
			    8th of that month. In a letter of 14 June to his factor and amanuensis
			    William Laidlaw, Scott indicates that he is keen to begin dictating
			    the new novel. It is unlikely, however, that he had begun before
			    suffering a recurrence of his illness in mid-June. According
			    to Lockhart, this was so severe that Scott believed he was on
			    the point of death and, at one point, called his family to his
			    bedside so that he might take his leave. By 2 July, Scott
			    was sufficiently recovered to have begun dictating the novel.
			    It appears, from the extant manuscript, that Scott dictated most
			    of the first two volumes before resuming writing by hand sometime
			    before 19 August (by which date the second volume was complete).</p>
			<p>Work on the third volume was very much slower due to a hold-up at the printers
			  who were suffering a shortage of paper. Scott also complains of
			  a 'very slow transcriber' (possibly Laidlaw) whose job it was to
			  transcribe Scott's manuscript in order to preserve the anonymity
			  of the 'Author of <em>Waverley</em>'. It seems likely that Scott, in his
			  frustration, may have temporarily laid aside <em>Ivanhoe</em> and began
			  work on <em>The Monastery</em>. Despite the delay the novel was complete
			  by 10 November, but persisting paper shortages ensured that it
			  was not published in Edinburgh until 18 December. London publication
			  had to wait until 31 December, as the ship carrying copies to Scott's
			  London publisher Hurst, Robinson, and Co. was caught in a storm.
			  Published so close to the end of the year, <em>Ivanhoe</em> bore the date
			  1820 on its title-page.</p>

			<p><em>Ivanhoe</em> is set in 1194, when Richard I returned from the Third Crusade
			  to reclaim his kingdom from his brother John, who had usurped
			  much of Richard's power during his long absence in the Holy Land.
			  For his portrayal
			  of Saxon England, Scott drew extensively on Robert Henry's <em>The History
			  of Great Britain</em>,
			  Sharon Turner's <em>The History of the Anglo-Saxons from the Earliest Period
			  to the Norman Conquest</em>, and Joseph Strutt's <em>Sports and Pastimes
			  of the People of England</em>. For the characterization of Richard I, Scott
			  drew on Henry again and on David Hume's <em>The History of England</em>.
			  In many areas of the novel, however, literary sources proved as
			  important as scholarly works. In his
			  depiction of medieval England, Scott takes much from Chaucer's <em>Canterbury
			  Tales</em>. Shakespeare's <em>King John</em> is a clear influence on Scott's
			  depiction of Richard's brother and <em>A Merchant of Venice</em> on Scott's
			  Jewish characters. Finally, numerous details are suggested by Joseph
			  Ritson's <em>Robin Hood: A Collection
			  of All the Ancient Poems, Songs, and Ballads</em>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>

			<h3><font color="#003366"><a name="synopsis" id="synopsis"></a>Synopsis</font></h3>
			<p>The novel's hero, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, is the son of Cedric, a Saxon 
              nobleman. In the hope of one day restoring the Saxon dynasty, Cedric 
              wishes to marry his ward Rowena, a descendant of Alfred the Great, 
              to Athelstane of Coningsburgh, a descendant of Edward the Confessor. 
              Ivanhoe's love for Rowena, however, threatens these plans, leading 
              Cedric to disinherit him. Ivanhoe joins the Third Crusade, and, 
              fighting alongside Richard the Lionheart in the Holy Land, wins 
              the King's favour. The novel begins with Ivanhoe's return to England, 
              where Prince John is plotting to depose his brother Richard, who 
              has been taken captive in Austria on his way home from the Crusades. 
            </p>
			<p>On his way to a great tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Ivanhoe 
              visits his father's house disguised as a pilgrim. Here he saves
			   the life of Isaac, a rich Jew of York, by warning him of a
			  planned ambush. At Ashby, Ivanhoe, with the help of the King who
			  has returned to England in disguise, vanquishes
			   all of King John's supporters, including his great personal enemy,
			   the Templar Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert and the brutal baron Front-de-Boeuf.
			  
              Ivanhoe is wounded in the tournament and nursed back to health
			  by Isaac's daughter Rebecca. Bois-Guilbert and Front-de-Boeuf then
			  assist a mercenary leader Maurice de Bracy
			   in a plan to abduct Rowena. Her travelling party, which includes
			   Cedric, Athelstane, Isaac, Rebecca, and the still-recovering Ivanhoe,
			   is attacked and all are led captive to Front-de-Boeuf's Castle
			  of  Torquilstone. Here Rowena and Rebecca courageously resist the
			  advances 
              of, respectively de Bracy and Bois-Guilbert, who has become enamoured
			   of the Jewess. The castle is successfully besieged by a band of
			   Saxons and outlaws, led by Locksley (alias Robin Hood) and King
			   Richard himself, and the prisoners liberated except Rebecca, whom
			   Bois-Guilbert carries off to the Preceptory of Templestowe.<br>
            </p>
			<p align="center"><img src="graphics/cc91.gif" width="223" height="288" alt="Rebecca, engraving by Albert Henry Payne, 1851 (Corson A.1.a.1851/2)"></p>
			<p>The unexpected arrival at Templestowe of the Grand Master of the 
              Knights Templar leads to a charge of witchcraft against Rebecca, 
              who only manages to escape immediate execution by demanding trial 
              by combat. At the last moment, Ivanhoe appears as her champion to 
              a face a reluctant Bois-Guilbert who has been commanded to represent 
              his order. At the first pass, Bois-Guilbert falls dead from his 
              horse, unwounded but 'a victim to the violence of his own contending 
              passions'. At the end, Richard reconciles Ivanhoe and Cedric, Athelstane 
              withdraws his claim to Rowena's hand, and Ivanhoe and Rowena marry. 
              Rebecca, stifling her love for Ivanhoe, accompanies her father to 
              Spain, where they hope to find a more tolerant society.</p>

			<p><i>Ivanhoe</i> was as much a success with the critics as it was 
              with the reading public. For Francis Jeffrey in the <i>Edinburgh
               Review</i>, the work showed 'at least as much genius as any of
               those  with which it must now be numbered'. For the <i>Literary
               Gazette</i>, 
              it was 'a performance of unequalled excellence' and, for the <i>Quarterly</i>,
               a 'splendid masque'. Their only major reservations concerned the
              
              relatively insipid Rowena and the improbability of Athelstane's
               resurrection from presumed death at the novel's conclusion. A
              rare 
              detractor was the <i>British Review</i> which detected an exhausted
               vein of inspiration and over-rapid, impromptu plotting.</p>
			<p><i>Ivanhoe</i> sold at a phenomenal rate. Within less than two 
              weeks, the entire first printing of 10,000 copies was exhausted 
              and the demand for more copies put the printers under serious pressure. 
              Translated into numerous languages, it marked the beginning of Scott's 
              European vogue and the emergence of the historical novel as an international 
              phenomenon. </p>
