            <p><img src="graphics/cc86.gif" alt="Loch Leven Castle, engraving by Andrew Wilson, 1825 (Corson A.18.2.1.DRAM.WAV.1824)" width="250" height="216" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">Along amongst the Waverley Novels, <em>The Abbot</em> was explicitly
              presented as the sequel to an earlier volume. The Introductory
              Epistle to the First Edition informs the reader that the narrative
              is the continuation of the Benedictine manuscript from which Scott
              purported
              to have
              drawn his preceding novel <a href="monastery.html"><em>The Monastery</em></a> which
              had dealt with the early years of the Reformation in Scotland.
               A decade later, in his introduction to the Magnum Opus edition
              of <em>The Abbot </em>(1831), Scott hinted that the decision to
              set a second novel in Reformation Scotland stemmed precisely from
              the
              relative
              failure, critical
              and commercial, of <em>The Monastery</em>. Fleshing out Scott's
              suggestion, his twentieth-century biographers Sir Herbert Grierson
              and Edgar Johnson (see <a href="../bibliography.html">Bibliography</a>)
              portray an unbowed Scott making a second effort to conquer resistant
              subject-matter. Christopher Johnson, editor of the recent Edinburgh
              Edition of <em>The Abbot </em>(2000), calls this account into question.
              He notes that the contract for a sequel was signed before the completion
              of <em>The Monastery</em> and finds evidence that Scott was considering
              a novel depicting the imprisonment of Mary Queen of Scots at Lochleven
              Castle as early as summer 1817.</p>
            <p>Scott's surviving correspondence suggests that he originally intended
              to deal with the dissolution of the monasteries and the imprisonment
              and escape of Queen Mary in the same novel. Scott did some preliminary
              work on <em>The Monastery</em> in August 1819 but only after the
              completion of <a href="ivanhoe.html"><em>Ivanhoe</em></a> in the
              first week of November did he turn his full attention to the novel.
              As early as 8 November, however, he wrote to <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John
              Ballantyne</a> to announce that <em>The Monastery</em> would run
              to four volumes or ('which is much better') be published in two
              parts comprised of three volumes each. Ballantyne subsequently
              proposed a sequel to the publisher Longmans in late December 1819,
              and the offer was promptly accepted. Scott's eagerness to publish
              the novel in two parts most likely stemmed from financial rather
              than aesthetic considerations. He stood in need of ready cash to
              meet expenses arising from his son's receipt of a military commission
              and from recent extensions to the <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> estate.
              A second publisher's advance, duly received in January 1820, would
              provide a much-needed injection of capital. Throughout the negotiations
              for the sequel, the novel is referred to solely as the second 'part',
              'branch', or 'class' of <em>The Monastery</em>. Only on 29 March
              do Constable's records first refer to <em>The Abbot</em> by its
              eventual title. </p>
            <p>Relatively little is known about the composition process of <em>The
                Abbot</em>, the surviving manuscript of which is incomplete.
                When <em>The Monastery</em> was published in March 1820, it seems
                likely that Scott did not immediately set to work on the sequel.
                According to a letter to Lady Abercorn, only half of the first
                volume was complete by 1 June. The intervening weeks had been
                hectic. Scott had travelled to London in March to receive his
                baronetcy, and had married his daughter Sophia to his future
                biographer John Gibson Lockhart on 29 April. The enforced break
                from writing had permitted Scott to gauge the largely negative
                public reaction to <em>The Monastery</em> and to re-organize
                his material so as to render <em>The Abbot</em> an autonomous
                narrative. In particular, he chose to abandon the White Lady,
                guardian spirit of the House of Avenel, who had displeased critics
                and readers alike. In the summer, Scott made rapid progress on
                the novel. The first two volumes were complete by 8 July, and
                the novel was advertised as due to be published in August. An
                overlong third volume occasioned a slight delay, and <em>The
                Abbot</em> finally appeared in Edinburgh on 2 September and in
                London on 4 September. As with <em>The Monastery</em>, publication
                was managed by Longmans of London, with Scott's usual publisher
                Constable temporarily relegated to the role of co-publisher. </p>

            <p>The novel takes place between July 1567 and May 1568, spanning
              the imprisonment of Mary Queen of Scots at Lochleven, her enforced
              abdication, her escape from the Castle, defeat at Langside and
              subsequent flight to England. The events covered in the novel seal
              the triumph of the Protestant, pro-English party in England and
              ultimately pave the way to the Union of the English and Scottish
              Crowns under a Protestant monarch. Scott drew on the large collection
              of printed works relating to Mary that he had gathered at Abbotsford.
              Besides polemicists like the Protestants George Buchanan and John
              Knox and the Catholic John Leslie, Scott made use of eighteenth-century
              collections of original source material such as Samuel Jebb's <em>De
              Vita &amp; Rebus Gestis Serenissimae Principis Mariae Scotorum
              Reginae</em> and Robert Keith's <em>The History of the Affairs
              of the Church and State in Scotland</em>. Scott also acknowledges
              his debt to George Chalmers's more recent <em>Life of Mary, Queen
              of Scots</em>, the publication of which in 1818 may have helped
              fix his interest on Mary's reign.<em> </em>Scott's hero, Roland
              Graeme, is a fictional character, but his theft of the keys of
              Lochleven Castle and liberation of the Queen are based on the actions
              of Willie Douglas, an orphan belonging to the Lochleven household,
              who remained a loyal servant of Mary until her death.</p>

            <p>The orphaned hero, Roland Graeme, is brought up as a page by Lady
              Mary Avenel, heroine of <em>The Monastery</em> and now wife to
              Sir Halbert Glendinning. Although considered a penniless bastard,
              Roland becomes a favourite with his childless mistress until his
              impetuous character leads to his dismissal. Assisted by Sir Halbert,
              Roland enters the service of the Earl of Murray who, following
              the enforced abdication of Mary Queen of Scots, governs Scotland
              as Regent on behalf of the infant James VI. Murray appoints him
              as a page to the imprisoned Queen Mary and sends him to Lochleven
              Castle with instructions to act as a spy. However, Roland's sense
              of honour, his loyalty to Mary (instilled by his Catholic grandmother,
              Madgalen Graeme), and his love for Catherine Seyton, one of Mary
              Stuart's attendants, prevent him from acting out this role. In
              the end, Roland becomes instrumental in the queen's escape, remaining
              with her until she leaves Scotland. In this, he is assisted by
              the Abbot of Kennaquhair, Father Ambrosius (formerly Edward Glendinning),
              from whom the novel takes its title. Shortly before Mary's defeat
              at Langside, Roland discovers his true identity. He is not, as
              he thought, the illegitimate child of Catherine Graeme but the
              product of a legitimate marriage between Catherine and Julian Avenel,
              and thus heir to his benefactress's estates. Roland is pardoned
              by the Regent and marries Catherine Seyton.</p>

            <h3><font color="#003366"><a name="reception" id="reception"></a>Reception</font></h3>
            <p>With the publication of <i>The Abbot</i>, Scott regained the reputation
              he had established with <i>Ivanhoe</i>. The success of <i>The Abbot</i> was
              proof to him that the sixteenth century provided fertile ground
              for historical fiction and he would return to the period with his
              next novel <em><a href="kenilw.html">Kenilworth</a></em>. Lochleven
              Castle became a favourite destination for sightseers and the success
              of <em>The Abbot</em> prompted a revival of interest in (and partial reappraisal
              of) T<em>he Monastery</em>. Reviews were largely favourable, with <i>Blackwood's</i>,
              the <i>Literary Gazette,</i> and the <i>Quarterly Review</i> being
              particularly enthusiastic. The <i>Quarterly </i>singled out Scott's
              skill in interweaving the loves of Catherine and Roland and the
              fate of Queen Mary: 'Never was a double plot better connected.'
              Reservations were expressed by the<i> Edinburgh Review</i> and <i>Edinburgh
              Magazine</i>. The former, while admiring the passages relating
              to Mary's escape and the battle of Langside, did not approve of
              the title of the novel, arguing that the Abbot played only a minor
              part, and described Catherine Seyton as a 'wilful deterioration
              of Diana Vernon'. The latter protested against the levity of Queen
              Mary and the coarseness of her language, arguing that both were
              unhistorical.</p>
