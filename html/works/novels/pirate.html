(Corson MSS)" width="242" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Having suggested both title and subject-matter for <a href="kenilw.html"><em>Kenilworth</em></a>,
              Scott's publisher Archibald Constable was again to provide the
              original spark for
              Scott's next novel <em>The Pirate</em>. Scott had contracted with
              Constable to publish five novels after <em>Kenilworth</em>. A
              letter from Scott's agent
              <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John Ballantyne</a> to Constable
              dated 21 August 1820 set out Scott's terms for the first of these
              and proposed a publication date of June 1821. At this stage, however,
              neither the title nor the subject-matter had been settled upon,
              and Scott was yet to begin work on <em>Kenilworth</em> itself.
               On 25 December 1820, two days before the completion of <em>Kenilworth</em>,
              Constable wrote to Scott proposing <em>The Bucanier</em> as
              a possible title for his next novel. He suggested that Scott narrate
              the adventures of John Dixwell,
              Edward Whalley, and William Goffe, three 'regicides' (signatories
              to the Death Warrant
              of Charles
              I)
               who fled to New England following
              the Restoration  and were taken captive
              by pirates. Scott adopted the suggestion of giving a pirate a central
              role, but rejected Constable's further plot hints. Instead he
              drew on memories of two weeks spent in Orkney and Shetland in 1814
              as one of a party of Commissioners for the Northern
              Lighthouse Service (see <a href="../poetry/lord.html"><em>The
              Lord of the Isles)</em></a>. As well as taking the opportunity
              to learn much of the physical features, economy,
              superstitions and
              manners of the islands, Scott had
              heard the tale of the 'Orkney Pirate' John Gow. Pursued by the
                authorities and running low on supplies, Gow had returned home
                to Orkney to lie low for a period. There he had assumed the part
                of 'Mr Smith', a respectable, prosperous trader, and, in that
              capacity, courted a Miss Gordon. Eventually, however, Gow
                was recognised
                by the captain of a visiting merchant vessel, and the alarm was
              raised. His cover blown, Gow attacked the house of a local landowner,
                carrying off valuables, and abducting two maidservants. An unsuccessful
                attack on a second Orkney mansion led to Gow's arrest and subsequent
                execution. Many elements of Gow's story appear, transformed,
              in Scott's <em>The Pirate</em>.</p>
            <p align="left">The composition of <em>The Pirate</em> was an uncharacteristically
              protracted affair. It was the only novel that Scott completed in
              1821. He had written eleven novels in the previous seven years
              and would write six more in the next four. However, almost exactly
              a year passed between Constable's suggestion of title and subject-matter
              and the eventual publication of <em>The Pirate</em> in December
              1822. Extra-literary engagements occupied Scott for much of 1821.
              He made two lengthy trips to London, first on legal business (January-April),
              and then to attend the coronation of George IV in July. During
              the summer, Scott was preoccupied by extensive building work at
              <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>. He was further
              delayed by other literary commitments. In the course
              of
              the year, Scott published his <em>Private Letters of the Seventeenth
              Century</em> (an account of the early years of the
              reign of James VI and I), an edition of Richard Franck's <em>Northern
              Memoirs</em>, and, finally, an account of
              the life and works of Tobias Smollett for Ballantyne's Novelists'
              Library. The Novelists' Library, a series
              of economically priced reprints of popular novels and romances,
              was a project that John Ballantyne had
              long
            cherished. Sadly, he died in June 1821 after years of ill health.
              Scott saw through the publication of the series in memory of his
              dead friend, and provided biographical introductions to each volume. </p>
            <p align="left">Scott was also hampered, however, by the sheer unfamiliarity
              of his subject matter. Unlike previous novels, <em>The Pirate</em> would
              be set in a region little known to him, and both plot and characters
              would owe relatively little to 
              historical precedents. Scott began work on the novel by 18 or 19
              April 1821, but took until 9 August to complete the first volume.
              His pace quickened once he was firmly established at Abbotsford
              in September. Here he received significant assistance
              from a house-guest, his old school-friend William Erskine. Erskine
              had been a fellow Commissioner on Scott's 1814
              trip to
              the Northern
              Isles, and was now Sheriff of Orkney and Zetland (Shetland). He
              was thus able to supplement Scott's own recollections and research
              with first-hand knowledge of the region.   <em>The Pirate</em> was
              finished in the second half of October and, following a delay at
              the printing
              office, was published in Edinburgh on 21 or 22 December and in
              London on 24 December.</p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></font></p>            <h3><em><font color="#003366"><a name="sources" id="sources"></a></font></em><font color="#003366">Sources</font></h3>
            <p><em>The Pirate</em> is set at the end of the seventeenth century, a few
              decades earlier than the real-life events (the exploits of John
              Gow), on which they are loosely based. The editors of the recent
              Edinburgh Edition of the novel, Mark Weinstein and Alison Lumsden,
              convincingly argue that the plot unfurls between July and August
              1689, against the back-drop of the Glorious Revolution. By moving
              events further into the past, Scott was able to portray tension
              between the native Norse stock of the Northern Isles and the incoming
              Scots lairds (who had thoroughly imposed their language and customs
              by the days of John Gow). He is thus able to portray the old order
              succumbing to the new both locally and nationally. </p>            
            <p>Scott's most important source was his own  'Diary' of the 1814
              tour of the Western and Northern Isles as a Commissioners for the
              Northern Lighthouses (printed in Lockhart's <em>Memoirs
                of
                the
                Life
                of
                Sir Walter
                Scott, Bart.</em>). For information on Gow and pirate life, he
                drew on Captain Charles Johnson's <em>A General
                History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates </em>and
                the anonymous <em>History and Lives of the Most Notorious Pirates
                and their Crews</em>. He also received accounts of Gow from the
                historian Malcolm Laing, whose grandfather had helped capture
                Gow, and from Alexander
              Peterkin, Sheriff-Substitute of Orkney and Zetland. Perhaps, though,
              these sources proved less influential on the portrayal of Scott's
                pirate hero, Captain Cleveland, than on that of his villainous
                associate Captain Goffe. Cleveland himself is essentially a Byronic
                anti-hero.
                Scott also learned from his re-reading of Smollett's novels while
                working on the biography for Ballantyne's Novelists' Library.
                The depiction of life at sea in <em>The Pirate</em> draws, in
                particular, on Smollett's
                <em>The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle</em>.</p>

            <p align="left"><i>The Pirate</i> is set in a remote part of Shetland,
              where Basil Mertoun lives as a tenant of Magnus Troil. In his youth,
              Mertoun has been betrayed by a faithless
              wife, and in a spirit of vengeance, turned to piracy. Filled with
              remorse for his crimes, he lives as a recluse, along with his wife's
              son Mordaunt, whose paternity is doubtful. Bewildered by Mertoun's
              coldness, Mordaunt frequents the Troil household and becomes close
              to Magnus's daughters Minna and Brenda. Their tranquillity is interrupted
              by the arrival of the shipwrecked pirate Clement Cleveland, whom
              Mordaunt rescues from the waves but whose enmity he quickly arouses.
              Minna and Cleveland fall in love. Magnus Troil, crediting a malicious
              rumour that Mordaunt has boasted he can marry either of his daughters
              at will, banishes him from his society, and takes Cleveland into
              his home. Brenda does not believe the slander, and in Mordaunt's
              absence, realizes she loves him. </p>
            <p>Mordaunt is assisted against Cleveland by Ulla Troil, a relative 
              of Magnus, known as Norna of the Fitful-head. Ulla, who lays claims 
              to supernatural powers, believes that Mordaunt is her son by Mertoun 
              who had seduced her during an earlier visit to the island. She wishes 
              to see Mertoun married to Minna and resolves to distance Cleveland 
              at all costs. Minna is horrified when Cleveland open-heartedly confesses 
              to her that he is a pirate. Hearing that his former colleagues are 
              moored at Kirkwall, Cleveland sets out for Orkney with the purpose 
              of disassociating himself from them. He is compelled, though, to 
              rejoin them against his own wishes and subsequently captured by 
              government forces acting on information supplied by Ulla. </p>
            <p>Cleveland is wrongly believed to have killed Mordaunt in a fight 
              before leaving Shetland, and the conscience-stricken Minna contracts 
              a wasting disease. Ulla, invoking her prophetic powers, persuades 
              the Trolls that she can only be cured by visiting Kirkwall Cathedral. 
              En route to Orkney, they are captured by another band of pirates, 
              and such is their brutality that Minna vows that she could never 
              marry one of their kind. They are rescued by Mordaunt who has merely 
              been wounded by Cleveland, and the grateful Magnus consents to his 
              marriage with Brenda. Having engineered Cleveland's capture, Ulla 
              discovers that he, not Mordaunt, is her son by Mertoun. In remorse, 
              Ulla renounces her role as prophetess and devotes herself to the 
              study of the Bible. Cleveland is pardoned in view of past acts of 
              humanity, and joins the navy. Mertoun retires to a foreign monastery; 
            Minna remains unmarried.</p>

            <p>Critical reaction to <i>The Pirate</i> was highly 
              polarized. Lavish praise came from the <i>Scotsman</i> and from 
              <i>Blackwood's</i>, for whom Scott was 'one of the greatest of all 
              national historians'. Also favourable were the<i> Edinburgh Magazine</i>, 
              extolling the 'gigantic, versatile and prolific powers of this matchless 
              Delineator of Nature', and the <i>New Edinburgh Review</i> which 
              judged the novel 'equal to any of the collection in the varied talent 
              and power which distinguish them all'. The former, however, regretted 
              the overlengthy descriptions of Shetlandic localities and customs, 
              and the latter found the plot highly improbable. These criticisms 
              were amplified in the hostile notices that appeared in <i>The Gentleman's 
              Chronicle</i>, <i>Literary Chronicle</i>, and <i>Examiner</i>, which 
              suggested that <i>The Pirate</i> worked better as an essay on Shetlandic 
              manners than as a piece of fiction. Despite these critical reservations, 
              <i>The Pirate</i> was an immediate success and remained one of Scott's 
              most popular and most reprinted works throughout the nineteenth 
            century.</p>
