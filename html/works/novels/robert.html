              was around February 1826, in the middle of writing 
              <a href="cavalier.html"><i>Woodstock</i></a>, that Scott read the 
              <i>Chronicles of the Good Knight Messire Jacques Lalain</i>. Although
              he found much of it dull and repetitious, Scott soon recognized
              that it could be turned into a chivalric romance. It was more than
              four years later, though, in the autumn of 1830, that he actually
              set to work upon the story. Scott's publisher Cadell and those
              around him tried to persuade
              him to write something on a less epic scale, but, despite his rapidly
              deteriorating health, Scott sought a challenge. He believed that
              there was great potential in describing the declining Byzantine
              Empire as it confronted both Western Christendom and the advancing
              Ottoman Empire.While working on <i>Count Robert</i>, Scott's imagination
               was also fired by the tale of Douglas Castle, and he begun to
              work 
              simultaneously on <a href="dangerous.html"><i>Castle Dangerous</i></a>,
               with a view to publishing the two novels together as a fourth
              series 
              of <i>Tales of My Landlord</i>. Friends and associates feared the
               effects of overwork (Scott suffered two strokes while working
              on 
              <i>Count Robert</i>), and doctors advised him to seek a healthier
               climate abroad. A defiant Scott, though, agreed to travel only
              once 
              the two novels were finished. He worked on, plagued by self-doubt,
               and in the face of heavy criticism of both novels from <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">Ballantyne</a>.
                Never before had writing been so laborious, and despite intense
               
              revision, Scott remained dissatisfied with <i>Count Robert</i>,
               fearing it would never be better than 'mended china' (letter to
              
              Cadell, 3 July 1831). It was eventually published along with <i>Castle
               Dangerous</i> on December 1, 1831. </p>

            <p><i>Count Robert</i> is set during the reign of the Byzantine Emperor 
              Alexius Comnenus (1081-1118) and focuses on the arrival of the first 
              Crusaders in 1096. During the oath-taking ceremony on the eve of 
              the Crusade, the haughty Count Robert insults the Emperor by seating 
              himself on the imperial throne. Also offended is Robert's friend 
              Hereward, a Saxon member of the Varangian guard, exiled from England 
              after the Norman Conquest. When the Crusaders leave Byzance for 
              Asia, Robert is drugged and detained as captive. His Amazonian wife, 
              Brenhilda is held separately and persecuted by the enamoured Nicephorus 
              Briennus, the emperor's son-in-law. Brenhilda challenges Nicephorus 
              to combat, promising to give herself to him if defeated. In the 
              meantime, Robert is freed by Hereward, and presents himself at the 
              duel in his wife's stead. Nicephorus, though, does not appear as 
              he has been arrested following the discovery of a plot to usurp 
              Alexius. Still keen to avenge Robert's affront to the Emperor, Hereward 
              takes his place. Robert defeats him but spares his life in gratitude 
              for his earlier help. Hereward follows Robert to Palestine as a 
              vassal, after discovering that his lost Saxon love Bertha is Brenhilda's 
              waiting-woman. Through Robert's influence, a portion of Hereward's 
            English property is restored to him.</p>

              volume. Most were uneffusive but respectful, with only the <i>Gentleman's 
              Magazine</i> considering it an unqualified success, and only the 
              <i>Monthly Review</i> branding it 'an unfortunate production'. The 
              <i>Edinburgh Literary Journal</i> summed up the thoughts of many 
              critics and non-professional readers, judging that the two novels 
              'must rank among the least successful of Sir Walter's works, and 
              yet they bear about them sufficient traces of his genius to redeem 
              them from absolute failure, even were they not his farewell gift 
              to the public'.</p>
