                  <p align="left"><em>Saint Ronan's Well</em> is the only one
                    of Scott's novels with a nineteenth-century setting. According
                    to J.G. Lockhart, in his <em>Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter
                    Scott, Bart.</em> (1837-38), the novel was sparked by a suggestion
                    made in July 1823 by William Laidlaw, Scott's friend, factor,
                    and amanuensis. Hearing Scott declare that he was thinking
                    of setting his next novel in Germany, Laidlaw urged him to
                    stay on home ground. Why not, he proposed, try his hand at
                    portraying the present-day domestic tragedies and comedies
                    of a small Borders town like Melrose? Lockhart's dating is
                    problematic, as there is clear evidence that Scott began
                    the novel in May 1823, but no alternative account has been
                proposed of the novel's genesis.</p></td>

            </table>            
            <p>On 13 May 1823, a mere ten days after the completion
              of <a href="durward.html"><em>Quentin Durward</em></a>, Scott's
              publisher Archibald Constable heard from his partner (and eventual
              successor) Robert Cadell that Scott had begun work on a new novel.
              In little over a fortnight, Scott had written half of the first
              volume, and Cadell planned to announce its publication for July.
              At this stage, however, a decision was taken to defer publication
              until October. Sales of <em>Quentin Durward</em>, which had appeared
              only four months after <a href="peak.html"><em>Peveril of the Peak</em></a>,
              were worryingly slow. Constable and Cadell both began to fear that
              the market was glutted with Scott product. Scott agreed to curtail
              work on the novel during the summer, and only completed the first
              volume in late August or early September. A fresh turn of speed,
              however, had Scott inform Constable on 14 September that the novel
              was half-finished. By mid-October he had written the bulk of the
              third and final volume, and the novel looked likely to appear in
              late October or November. Yet the final text was only delivered
              to the printers in December, and neither Scott's correspondence
              nor surviving papers clearly indicate the grounds for
              this unexpected delay.            </p>
            <p align="left">Mark Weinstein, editor of the recent Edinburgh Edition
              of <em>Saint Ronan's Well</em> (1995), suggests that it was caused
              by a drawn-out disagreement over the novel's conclusion. According
              to Lockhart's biography, <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
              Ballantyne</a>, Scott's printer and business-partner, had been
              scandalized by indications that the sham marriage between the
              heroine Clara Mowbray and villain Valentine Bulmer had
              been consummated. Constable
              had backed
              Ballantyne
              up, and Scott at length agreed to rewrite the episode, although
              he always felt that the plot was seriously weakened as a result.
              Having examined Scott's manuscript, Weinstein concludes that the
              scandal lay elsewhere. There is no suggestion in the manuscript
              that Clara's marriage with Bulmer was consummated. It is revealed,
              however, that seven years before the action of the novel begins
              Clara had sexual intercourse with Bulmer's love rival Francis
              Tyrrel on the understanding that they would subsequently marry.
              It was this stain on Clara's virtue that Scott was persuaded to
              wipe clean. The Edinburgh Edition of <em>Saint Ronan's Well</em> restores
              Scott's original text, as there is clear evidence that the revision
              was made reluctantly and imperfectly, leaving many perplexing loose
              threads throughout the novel. </p>
            <p align="left"><em>Saint Ronan's Well</em> was published in Edinburgh
              on 27 December 1823, although the title-page bore the date '1824'.
              Scott indicates that the narrative is set some twenty years before
              the publication date. However, the many specific historical and
              local references in the text place the story at any point between
              1803 and 1818. Mark Weinstein suggests that the most salient and
              consistent references place the action between 1809 and 1812 at
              the height of the Peninsular War. </p>

            <p align="left">Lockhart suggested that the plot originated in an
              undisclosed 'tale of dark domestic guilt' which Scott had come
              across as Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire (see <a href="../../biography/law.html">Professional
              Life</a>). John W. Cairns, in a 1993 article (see <a href="../bibliography.html">Bibliography</a>),
              argues that elements of the plot emerge from the case of John Henry
              William Dalrymple and Johanna Gordon which Scott would have encountered
              not as a Sheriff but as Clerk to the Court of Session. Like Clara
              and Tyrrel, Dalrymple and Gordon had entered into a sexual liaison
              on promise of marriage. Dalrymple had subsequently abandoned Gordon
              and married a second
              party. Gordon's lawyers were
              able
              to persuade
                the Court of Session that she was married to Dalrymple under
              Scots Law, and that his official union was bigamous. Cairns's
              suggestion
              is adopted by Weinstein in the recent Edinburgh Edition, but in
              a
                series of articles for <em>The Scott Newsletter</em>, Richard
                D. Jackson has recently argued that the true 'tale of dark domestic
                guilt' involved two inhabitants of Darnick by Melrose, Helen
                and
                Elizabeth Milne (see <a href="../bibliography.html">Bibliography</a>). Jackson also argues that
                Melrose is a persuasive model for the fictional spa-town of Saint
                Ronan's.
                Saint Ronan's
                has traditionally been associated with Innerleithen which developed
                a healthy nineteenth-century tourist trade on the back of its
              supposed Scott connections.</p>
            <p align="left">Once again, literary suggestions may have contributed
              as much to the plot as real-life sources. There are echoes of Sheridan's <em>The
              Rivals</em>, and Thomas Otway's <em>The Orphan</em> together with
              numerous references to Shakespearian tragedy. Another factor may
              well have been Scott's longstanding admiration for the novels of
              Jane Austen and curiosity to see whether he could produce something
              in a similar vein.</p>

            <p align="left">The novel portrays the fashionable society of the
              fictional spa-town of Saint Ronan's. The plot revolves around the
              enmity of two half-brothers, Valentine Bulmer and Francis Tyrrel.
              Their father, the Earl of Etherington has secretly married Tyrrel's
              mother abroad, then later made a public marriage to Bulmer's mother.
              Bulmer is thus the recognized heir and Tyrrel considered to be
              illegitimate. Bulmer tries to sow discord between the Earl and
              his half-brother, by encouraging Tyrrel's secret courtship of Clara
              Mowbray. Discovering however that union with Clara would bring
              fortune and earn the Earl's favour, he impersonates Tyrrel at a
              midnight marriage. The brothers quarrel and Tyrrel spares Bulmer's
              life on condition that he leave Saint Ronan's, and permit Clara
              to continue living under her maiden name. The Earl dies and Bulmer
              inherits his title. His profligacy has led him to the brink of
              financial ruin when he learns that he will inherit a fortune if
              Clara acknowledges their marriage. He returns to Saint Ronan's
              to persecute her and blackmails Clara's brother, John, a fellow
              gambler, into threatening his sister's life if she does not accept
              him as her husband. Tyrrel meanwhile is expecting papers which
              will prove his own claim to the earldom. Bulmer intercepts them
              and thereby learns that he is himself illegitimate. His accomplices
              betray him, and his designs are exposed by Mr Touchwood, a benignly
              meddlesome nabob. The mental strain on Clara, though, proves too
              great and she dies from a brain haemorrhage. Bulmer is killed in
              a duel by John Mowbray. Tyrrel inherits the earldom but leaves
              Britain in despair.</p>

            <p align="left"><i>Saint Ronan's Well</i> was perhaps Scott's least
              favourably reviewed novel. Journals such as the <i>British Critic</i>,
              Edinburgh Magazine, and <i>Monthly Review</i> lamented that Scott
              had 'descended' from the realms of historical romance to a genre,
              the novel of contemporary manners, which many lesser writers had
              made their own. Others were more violent in their censure. For
              the <i>New European Magazine</i>, it was 'an abortive and contemptible
              sixth-rate novel', 'one of the weakest and most trashy productions
              that we have ever seen'. The <i>Literary Gazette</i> and <i>Universal
              Review</i> joined the <i>Literary Chronicle</i> in condemning Scott
              for 'obtruding an inferior work on the public'. Only the <i>Scotsman</i> found
              lukewarm praise for the novel. Indeed, Scottish readers in general
              reacted much more favourably to <i>Saint Ronan's Well</i> than
              their English counterparts, relishing the satirical portrayal of
              provincial would-be high society. Tourists flocked to Innerleithen,
              and despite Scott's own reservations about the novel's suitability
              for the stage, a theatrical adaptation proved a great success in
              Edinburgh.</p>
