			    <td width="65%">For his next novel, inspired by legends of the Highland cateran, Rob
			      Roy, Scott reverted to Archibald Constable. As he had already promised
			      him a <i>History of Scotland</i>, he felt it was only fair to offer
			      him any other publication which might delay its completion. He was also,
			      though, increasingly irritated with Blackwood, who, in the face of slow
			      sales, had suspended the printing of a new edition of <i>Tales of My
			      Landlord</i>, First Series. Feeling that it would be indelicate to attribute
			      the new novel to Jedediah Cleishbotham, he decided to reappear as the
			      'Author of <i>Waverley</i>', and was amused by the thought of bringing
			      his two <i>noms de plume </i>into direct competition. Constable jumped
			      at the opportunity of publishing a fresh Waverley novel and was even
		      persuaded to buy unsold stock from Blackwood as part of the deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td>

			<p align="left">The contract was signed in May 1817, and in July 1817 
              Scott visited Rob Roy's cave at the head of Loch Lomond and Glen 
              Falloch, in order to refresh his memories of the scene of the outlaw's 
              exploits. Work on the novel began in August 1817, but progress was 
              hampered by a recurrence of gallstone-related illness. Suffering 
              from intensely painful cramps, Scott was forced to take high quantities 
              of laudanum while dieting almost to the point of starvation. Astonishingly, 
              it was under these conditions that Scott wrote perhaps the most 
              fluently readable of all his stories. The novel was finished by 
              early December 1817 and was published on the 30th of the month.</p>

			<p align="left"><i>Rob Roy</i> is set against the backdrop of the 
                Jacobite Rebellion of 1715, which aimed to restore the Stuart
			  monarchy in the person of James Edward, the 'Old Pretender', son of the
			  deposed
                James II. The tale is told in the first person by a young Englishman,
			  Francis ('Frank') Osbaldistone. A would-be poet, Frank falls out
                with his father, William, due to his reluctance to enter the
			  family business. Frank is sent north to Northumbria to stay with his Jacobite
			  uncle, Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, and his place in William's counting
                house goes to Sir Hildebrand's scheming son Rashleigh. Frank
			  falls in love with Sir Hildebrand's niece, Diana Vernon who lives in Osbaldistone
			  Hall. Her father Sir Frederick, a proscribed Jacobite, lives there
                too in the guise of a monk, Father Vaughan. Sir Frederick has
			  destined Diana for a convent unless she marries one of Sir Hildebrand's
			  six
                sons. Diana, then, cannot listen to Frank's suit but, when Rashleigh
			  flees to Scotland with vital financial documents, she assists him
                in his attempts to restore his father's honour and credit. Frank
			  enlists the help of Bailie Nicol Jarvie, a Glasgow business correspondent
			  of his father, and both proceed to the Highlands to bid Rob Roy,
                a political dependent of the Vernons, to intervene. Rashleigh
			  is compelled to restore the company assets, and Frank returns to England
			  where he is reconciled with his father. Meanwhile, the Jacobite
                rebellion breaks out. Sir Hildebrand's other five sons are all
			  killed in the fighting, and he himself dies shortly afterwards of grief.
			  Rashleigh, who has become an informer, is killed by Rob Roy during
                an attempt on Frank's life. Sir Frederick escapes to France,
			  leaving Diana free to decide her future. The path is thus clear for Frank
			  to inherit Osbaldistone Hall and marry Diana. </p>

			<h3 align="left"><i><font color="#003366"><a name="reception" id="reception"></a></font></i><font color="#003366">Reception</font></h3>			<p>Critical response to <i>Rob Roy </i>was almost unanimously favourable. 
              For his power of characterization, Scott was now frequently compared 
              with Shakespeare, with particular praise reserved for Bailie Nicol 
              Jarvie and Andrew Fairservice, Frank's shrewd but cowardly manservant. 
              The only substantial complaint on this count came from Francis Jeffrey 
              in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, who perceived improbabilities in 
              Scott's portrayal of Diana Vernon. Her manners, maturity and firmness 
              of character, he argued, were unlikely given the society she grew 
              up in. Readers, however, were enchanted by her boldness and wit. 
              The novel was a tremendous commercial success, the original print 
              run of 10,000, a huge figure for the time, being bought up in two 
              weeks. </p>
