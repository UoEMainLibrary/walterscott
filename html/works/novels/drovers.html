            <p align="left">'The Two Drovers' is based on an account that Scott
              had heard many years previously of the trial and execution in Carlisle
              of a Highland
              cattle
              drover
              accused of the murder of an English drover. Scott's source, which
              he acknowledged in the 'Magnum Opus' edition of <em>Chronicles
              of the Canongate</em> (1831), was George Constable (1719-1803),
              a friend of his father and the model
              for Jonathan
              Oldbuck
              in <a href="antiquary.html"><em>The Antiquary</em></a>. It has
              not been established to date whether Constable's anecdote
              refers to a historically
              verifiable case.</p>

              Croftangry, narrator of <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>, presents
              'The Two Drovers' as an illustration of the Highland concept of
              honour.
              Set in the late eighteenth century, it involves a dispute between
              two cattle drovers, the Highlander Robin Oig M'Combich and his
              friend
              Harry
              Wakefield,
              a
              Yorkshireman. When they put up together at an inn in Cumberland,
              a misunderstanding arises over pasturage for their cattle. The
              hot-tempered
              Harry, egged on by local bullies, challenges Robin to a fist-fight
              in the English manner to settle the question. Robin refuses, insisting
              he will either fight like a Highland gentleman with a broadsword
              or appeal to the law. Harry knocks him to the floor and promptly
              forgets the quarrel. Robin, leaves the inn, walks twelve miles
              to
              fetch his dirk (Highland dagger), and returns to kill Harry with
              one blow. He then gives himself up to justice and goes to his execution,
              happy
              to
              give his life for the life he took. Chrystal Croftangry claims
              to have been present at his trial as a young lawyer. </p>
