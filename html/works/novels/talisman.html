                <td width="53%">The theme of the Crusades attracted Scott at different times
                  throughout his writing career. In 1817 he discussed it in his &quot;Essay
                  on Chivalry&quot;, in which he suggested that the real history
                  of the Crusades was founded on the spirit of chivalry, and
                  that this spirit led to the creation of the earliest chivalric
                  orders, namely the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem
                  (Hospitallers), the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ, and
                  the Order of the Temple of Solomon (Templars), all originally
                  devoted to the service of pilgrims to the Holy Land. Towards
                  the end of his career, Scott returned to the subject for <i>The
                  Talisman</i>, published along with <i><a href="betrothed.html">The

            <p>This novel focuses on the Third Crusade which had been triggered 
              by the conquest in 1187 of almost the whole of Palestine, including 
              Jerusalem, by Salah-ed-Din Yusef ibn Ayub or Saladin. The plot revolves 
              around the Crusaders' camp in the Holy Land which is being torn 
              apart by tensions between rival leaders. The most influential, Richard 
              the Lionheart, is ill, which accentuates the divisions among the 
              Christian forces. On a mission far from the camp, the poor Scottish 
              crusader Sir Kenneth, or the Knight of the Leopard, comes across 
              a Saracen emir with whom, after inconclusive combat, he strikes 
              up a friendship. The emir is none other than Saladin himself. He 
              manages to gain access to the Christian camp by disguising himself 
              as a physician sent to Richard the Lionheart, whom he quickly cures 
              with the aid of the talisman of the novel's title. Sir Kenneth is 
              entrusted to guard the banner of England during the night but he 
              is lured from his post by Queen Berengaria, Richard's wife, who 
              has an urgent message for him from Edith Plantagenet with whom Sir 
              Kenneth is enamoured. During his absence the English flag is torn 
              down and his faithful hound wounded. Sir Kenneth is dishonoured 
              and only escapes execution thanks to the emir who agrees to take 
              him as his slave. Saladin treats Kenneth kindly before the knight 
              returns to the camp disguised as a mute attendant to King Richard, 
              whom he saves from assassination. Richard sees through Sir Kenneth's 
              disguise but awards him the chance to find the man who wounded his 
              hound and tore down the banner. As the forces march past the re-erected 
              standard the hound leaps upon Richard's rival, Conrade of Montserrat, 
              and brings him down from his horse. A trial by combat is arranged 
              between Conrade and Sir Kenneth which the Scottish knight wins. 
              Afterwards Sir Kenneth is revealed to be Prince David of Scotland. 
              His royal status thus entitles him to pursue his union with Edith 
              Plantagenet.</p>

            <p>Charles Mills (1788-1826), who had written a <i>History of the 
              Crusades</i>, took offence at Scott's assertion in his introduction 
              to <i>The Talisman</i> that an Edith Plantagenet had existed. He 
              defied the novelist to produce evidence to support his statement 
              and accused Scott of deliberately misleading his readers. Indeed 
              <i>The Talisman</i> gave rise to much debate amongst the critics 
              as to the use that can be justifiably made of historical facts in 
              fiction. The <i>Quarterly Review</i> commended <i>The Talisman</i> 
              for surpassing grandeur and effect and praised the construction 
              of the story. The <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> praised characterization, 
              diction and costume but criticism the overuse of Oriental themes. 
              The <i>Examiner</i> asserted that Richard was by far the best character, 
              but that the novel in general was too melodramatic. Criticism from 
              the <i>London Magazine</i> focused upon Scott's descriptions of 
              clothes and furniture which it felt rendered the novel tedious. 
              Richard and Saladin were praised by most readers. More significantly 
              however, <i>The Talisman</i> is perhaps the first novel is English 
              to portray Muslims in a positive light.</p>
