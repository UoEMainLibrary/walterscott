            <p align="left"><img src="graphics/cc34.gif" alt="Plan of Kenilworth Castle, 182-? (Corson C.K.19)" width="289" height="144" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">There is little surviving evidence regarding the
              genesis of <em>Kenilworth</em>. Recent biographers and editors
              have largely accepted the account given by Scott's son-in-law J.
              G. Lockhart in his <em>Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott,
              Bart.</em> (1837-38). According to Lockhart, Scott's regular publisher
              Archibald Constable wrote to suggest that, after portraying Mary
              Queen of Scots in <a href="abbot.html"><em>The Abbot</em></a>,
              Scott depict her nemesis Elizabeth I of England in his next novel.
              Scott may well have wished to propitiate Constable, having chosen
              the London firm of Longmans to manage the publication of <a href="monastery.html"><em>The
              Monastery</em></a> and <em>The Abbot</em>. He took up Constable's
              suggestion but not, however, the additional hint that the novel
              be entitled <i>The Armada</i> and focus on the attempted Spanish
              invasion. He based the plot instead around the alleged murder of
              Amy Robsart, first wife of the Earl of Leicester, a story which
              he had first encountered in a favourite ballad of his childhood,
              William Julius Mickle's 'Cumnor Hall' (1784). <em>Cumnor Hall</em> was
              to be the original title of the novel but, according to Lockhart,
              Scott bowed to pressure from Constable and accepted his publisher's
              suggestion of <em>Kenilworth</em>. Constable's influence did not
              stop here. His bibliographical knowledge proved invaluable in providing
              Scott with an extensive list of background reading. So proud was
              Constable of his contribution to <em>Kenilworth</em> that, according
              to his partner Robert Cadell, he was given to exclaiming, 'By G--,
              I am all but the author of the Waverley Novels!'</p>
            <p align="left"> The letter containing Constable's original suggestion
              is lost but must have reached Scott in late December 1819 or early
              January 1820. A letter from Scott apparently acknowledging the
              suggestion is dated 12 January 1820. A contract for the new novel
              was signed as early as 18 January, even though Scott was still
              working on <em>The Monastery</em> and had yet to begin <em>The
              Abbot</em>. The new novel was originally scheduled to be published
              in late June 1820, but Scott did not complete <em>The Abbot</em> until
              August. He demanded a few weeks breathing space before starting
              work on <em>Kenilworth</em> in September. As the novel was complete
              by 27 December, however, it seems likely that Scott had previously
              engaged in extensive mental elaboration of the plot. Printing was
              complete by 5 January 1821 and the novel was published on 15 January
              in Edinburgh and 18 January in London. </p>
            <p align="left">The novel was published by Constable in partnership
              with the London firm of Hurst, Robinson, and Co. Negotiations between
              Constable and Longmans, originally designated as co-publisher,
              had broken down in October 1820. The association between Hurst,
              Robinson, and Co. and Constable would prove an unhappy one for
              Scott. The former's reckless involvement in speculation in 1825
              would lead to Constable's bankruptcy and to Scott's own crippling
              insolvency in 1826 (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html#1826">Financial
              Hardship</a>).</p>

            <p align="left">Scott had attained extensive familiarity with Elizabethan
              source material while preparing scholarly editions of <em>The Memoirs
              of Robert Cary, Earl of Monmouth</em>,<em> </em> Sir Robert Naunton's <em>Fragmenta
              Regalia</em> <em> </em>(both 1808) the <em>Somers Tracts</em> (1809-15),
              and Samuel Rowlands's <em>The Letting of Humours Blood</em> (1814).
              In addition, for the entertainment of Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth,
              he drew on Robert Laneham or Langham's undated and anonymous <em>A
              Letter</em> and George Gascoigne's <em>Palace of Princely Pleasures</em>,
              both of which he would have found in John Nichols's <em>The Progresses
              and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth</em> (1788). Scott consulted
              William Dugdale's <em>Antiquities of Warwickshire</em> (1656) for
              a detailed plan of Kenilworth Castle, which he had also visited,
              in its partially ruined state, on his way back from France in 1815.
              For the tale of Amy Robsart and Cumnor Hall, he drew on Elias Ashmole's <em>Antiquities
              of Berkshire</em> (1719). Again, however, literary sources proved
              as influential as the historical archives. For both plot and period
              language, Scott owed an extensive debt to Elizabeth and Jacobean
              drama, particularly Shakespeare's <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Othello</em>.</p>

            <p align="left">The heroine Amy Robsart enters into a secret marriage 
              with the Earl of Leicester, spurning her fianc&eacute;, Edmund Tressilian, 
              a Cornish gentleman. A favourite of Queen Elizabeth, Leicester feels 
              obliged to conceal his marriage in order to maintain his position 
              at court. Having fled her father's house, Amy is therefore kept 
              a virtual prisoner in Cumnor Place, an old country house. Tressilian 
              believes that Amy has been abducted by Leicester's Master of the 
              Horse, Varney, whom Leicester has used as a mask for his own amorous 
              intrigues. With the backing of Amy's distraught father, Sir Hugh, 
              Tressilian accuses Varney before the Queen of unlawful seduction. 
              In order to protect his patron, Varney swears that Amy is his wife. 
              Not altogether convinced, the Queen orders Varney to produce Amy 
              in that capacity during the projected revels at Leicester's castle 
              of Kenilworth. When Amy indignantly refuses to play this role, Varney 
              has poisons administered, which will provoke a mild illness and 
              thus excuse her absence. Amy, though, thwarts Varney's plan with 
              the assistance of Tressilian's page Wayland Smith and makes her 
              way to Kenilworth. Here, before she can make her husband aware of 
              her presence, she comes face to face with the Queen and appeals 
              for her aid against Varney. As she cannot bring herself to declare 
              her marriage to Leicester against her husband's wishes, the Queen 
              thinks her mad and consigns her, eventually, to Varney's care. Varney, 
              who sees in Amy an obstacle to his own ambition, persuades his patron 
              that she is having an affair with Tressilian, and the jealous Leicester 
              orders him to put her to death. Varney leaves Kenilworth with Amy 
              in order to carry out the murder at Cumnor Place. A messenger sent 
              to countermand the order, when Leicester has second thoughts, is 
              brutally killed. Back at Kenilworth, Tressilian, who is ignorant 
              of Amy's fate, makes a personal appeal to Leicester. Incensed, Leicester 
              challenges him to a duel and is on the point of killing him, when 
              the arrival of a delayed letter from Amy convinces him that Varney's 
              accusations are false. Leicester confesses her marriage to Elizabeth 
              who dispatches Tressilian to Cumnor Place to rescue Amy. He arrives 
              at the moment that Varney has engineered her death through a fall. 
              Varney is arrested and poisons himself in his prison cell; the heart-broken 
              Tressilian enlists on the Virginia expedition and dies an early 
              death; Leicester regains his privileged position at court after 
              a brief period of disgrace.</p>

            <p align="left"><i>Kenilworth</i> was an immediate success with both
              readers and critics. The <i>Edinburgh Review</i> praised Scott
              for bringing to life the character of Queen Elizabeth 'with the
              most brilliant and seducing effect'. The <i>Quarterly</i> declared
              that, while Scott's portrayal of Elizabeth did not quite live up
              to that of Mary in <a href="abbot.html"><i>The Abbot</i></a>, she
              was still a 'vivid and magnificent' character. As Scott had feared,
              however, the <i>Quarterly</i> along with the<i> Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
              thought the ending too tragic. The only serious adverse criticism
              came from the <i>British Review</i> which judged the novel 'a tedious
              performance' composed 'in a spirit of bookmaking'. Such, however,
              was the public response to the novel that sightseers flocked to
              Cumnor where the parish clerk made a small fortune out of showing
              visitors round the site of Cumnor Place. Lord Abingdon was widely
              criticized for having torn down the old mansion in 1810.</p>
