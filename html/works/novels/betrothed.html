                <td width="65%"><p align="left">Scott chose the Welsh Marches
                    during the reign of Henry II as the setting for his novel <i>The
                    Betrothed</i>. However, unfavourable feedback from <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">Ballantyne</a> and
                    Constable meant that Scott was not keen on finishing the
                    novel. Ballantyne found <i>The Betrothed</i> tiresome, and
                    Scott continued to rewrite parts of the text without reaching
                    a satisfactory result. With all but a chapter or two printed,
                    a despondent Scott was minded to withdraw it from publication.
                    Ballantyne and Constable, however, were understandably reluctant
                    to write off their collective labour and hit upon the idea
                    of publishing it together with <a href="talisman.html"><i>The
                    Talisman</i></a>, on which Scott was now working and which
                    they judged to be far superior. <i>The Talisman</i>'s merits,
                    they argued, would disguise the shortcomings of its companion
                    piece. Accordingly, the two novels appeared together as <i>Tales
                    of the Crusaders</i> on June 22, 1825.</p>

            <p align="left">The plot unfolds against the backdrop of border conflicts
              between the Anglo-Norman and Welsh barons. Having refused the hand
              of his daughter, Eveline, to the Welsh prince Gwenwyn, the Anglo-Norman
              Raymond Berenger is killed when the incensed Gwenwyn lays siege
              to his castle of Garde Douloureuse. His daughter is saved only
              by the intervention of Hugo de Lacy, Constable of Chester who,
              in turn, slays Gwenwyn. Out of gratitude rather than love, Eveline
              pledges herself to her elderly rescuer. Hugo, though, must fulfil
              a vow to join the Third Crusade and sets out immediately leaving
              Eveline under the guardianship of his nephew and heir Damian. Though
              both struggle against their feelings, an unconfessed love develops
              between the two youngsters during Hugo's three-year absence. When
              Damian is wounded defending Eveline from abduction, she takes him
              into her castle and nurses him. Although the couple remain chaste,
              malicious rumours are circulated concerning the nature of their
              relationship, and the King is moved to act against them. A royal
              force takes Garde Douloureuse, Damian is arrested, and Eveline's
              estates are declared forfeited. When Hugo returns from the Crusades
              he finds that the couple have been charged with high treason and
              with profiting from his absence to indulge their illicit love.
              Hugo is able to prove that the charges against Eveline and Damian
              are groundless, releases Eveline from her vow, and grants her permission
              to marry Damian.</p>

            <p align="left">Despite Scott's pessimism, <i>The Betrothed</i> was
              favourably received by both critics and public, and considered
              a worthy companion to <i>The Talisman</i>. The <i>Monthly Review</i>,
              however, thought it a 'dull tale', and the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> felt
              that it was heavy-going and clumsily constructed in parts. Posterity
              has been less kind. One biographer of Scott, Hesketh Pearson, wrote: &quot;<i>The
              Betrothed </i>was clearly composed in a somnolent if not stertorous
              condition, and would score high marks in a competition to decide
              which was the dreariest and stupidest book ever produced by a writer
              of genius.&quot; (<i>Walter Scott: His Life and Personality</i>,
              p. 54)</p>
