			      <p>Scott began work on <i>Castle Dangerous</i> while still
			        immersed in <i><a href="robert.html">Count Robert</a></i> <a href="robert.html"><i>of
			        Paris</i></a>, provoking panic amongst friends and associate as to
			        the possible effects of overwork on a now seriously weakened
			        constitution. The idea for the novel may have come from Cadell's suggestion
			        that the
			        deeds of Sir James Douglas, already covered in <i><a href="../prose/grandfather.html">Tales
			        of a Grandfather</a></i>, might provide the substance for a three-volume
			        novel. The legend of the castle had, though, long fascinated
			        Scott, who had provided a brief account of it as far back
			        as his 'Essay on
		        Chivalry' (1818).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p></td>

		    </table>			<p>As he worked on the novel, Scott became dissatisfied with his descriptions 
              of the Douglas area, which he had not visited since childhood. He 
              thus journeyed to Lanarkshire with Lockhart hoping to refresh his 
              impressions of the ruined castle and Douglas church and to pick 
              up local traditions and customs. In his biography of his father-in-law, 
              Lockhart records his distress at the waning of Scott's mental powers 
              and memory that became evident to him during this trip. Scott was 
              slightly better pleased with <i>Castle Dangerous</i> than with its 
              longer companion piece <i>Count Robert</i>. The two novels were 
              published together on December 1, 1831 as the Fourth Series of <i>Tales 
              of My Landlord</i>.</p>

		    <p><em>Castle Dangerous</em> is set in 1306 during the Wars of Independence. 
              An English heiress Lady Augusta de Berkely has promised to marry 
              Sir John de Walton if he can defend the strategically vital Castle 
              Douglas against the forces of Robert the Bruce and Sir James Douglas 
              (the 'Black Douglas') for a year and a day. Increasingly alarmed, 
              though, by the danger he is running, she travels to Douglasdale 
              in masculine disguise, accompanied by an old minstrel, Bertram. 
              She takes up residence in the Convent of St. Bride where she immediately 
              falls under suspicion of being a spy. When Sir John demands that 
              the mysterious youth be brought to Castle Douglas for questioning, 
              Augusta flees in shame and blunders into the hands of Sir James 
              Douglas. When her true identity is revealed, Douglas refuses to 
              deliver her to Sir John unless he surrender the castle. Sir John 
              refuses and engages in personal combat with Douglas. Still unresolved, 
              their conflict is ended by an order from Sir John's defeated ally, 
              the Earl of Pembroke, to surrender the castle. Douglas chivalrously 
              restores Lady Augusta to Sir John and, although he has been unable 
            to fulfil her conditions, she accepts his hand.</p>

			<h3><font color="#003366"><a name="crit"></a>Reception</font></h3>
			<p>Scott was astonished by the commercial success of <i>Castle Dangerous</i> 
              and <i>Count Robert</i>, neither of which he had deemed 'sea worthy'.
               He thought the public 'mad for passing thes[e] two volumes' (<i>Journal</i>,
                16 (or 26) January 1832) but began to hope that he might at last
               
              be able to write himself out of debt. For critical reaction, see
                the page devoted to <a href="robert.html"><i>Count Robert of
                Paris</i></a>.</p>
