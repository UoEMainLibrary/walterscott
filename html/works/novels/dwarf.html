                      tried another experiment on the reading public by adopting
                      a fresh <i>nom de plume</i> for his next narrative project,
                      the <em>Tales of My Landlord</em>. In the advertisement
                      placed at the head of <em>The Antiquary</em>, the 'Author
                      of <em>Waverley</em>' had announced that he was taking
                      'respectful leave' of the public 'as one who is not likely
                      again to solicit their favour'. Within months, however,
                      Scott had reappeared in the guise of Jedediah Cleishbotham,
                      schoolmaster and parish-clerk of the fictional town of
                      Gandercleuch. Cleishbotham purported to be editing or working
                      up stories originally sketched by a younger colleague,
                      the late Peter Pattieson. These, in turn, were supposed
                      to be based on tales told to Pattieson by the landlord
                      of the local Wallace Inn, hence <i>Tales of My Landlord</i>.
                      As the tales were to be published not by Archibald Constable
                      but by his rivals William Blackwood (Edinburgh) and John
                      Murray (London), Scott hoped that the public would believe
                      a new writer had appeared to challenge his own supremacy
                in the field of fiction. </td>

            <p align="left">The contract to write <em>Tales of My Landlord</em> was
              signed in 1816. Negotiations were conducted between William Blackwood
              and <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James Ballantyne</a>,
              Scott's printer and partner. James's brother John usually acted
              as Scott's literary agent but he was distrusted by both Blackwood
              and Murray. Despite all efforts to preserve Scott's anonymity,
              both publishers were certain that they were dealing with the 'Author
              of Waverley' and scarcely less sure that the author was Scott.</p>
            <p align="left">The <em>Tales of My Landlord</em> were originally
              intended to comprise four volumes, each containing a separate story
              set in a different region of Scotland: the Borders, the (south-)west,
              the Highlands, and Fife. Only the first two, <em>The Black Dwarf</em> and <a href="mortality.html"><em>Old
              Mortality</em></a>, were completed, the latter over-running its
              designated length to fill three of the four volumes. The idea of
              tying the tales together through the narrative voice of the pedantic
              schoolmaster Cleishbotham may well have occurred to Scott during
              the negotiations for the <em>Tales</em> in April 1816, when his
              antiquarian friend Joseph Train told him of his plan to compile
              a <em>History of Galloway</em>. This involved circulating a questionnaire
              among the parish clerks and schoolmasters of Galloway. One response
              which Train showed to Scott was humorously signed 'Clashbottom'.</p>

            <h3 align="left"><font color="#003366"><a name="composition"></a>Composition</font></h3>
            <p align="left">The first volume of the <em>Tales of My Landlord</em>, <em>The
                Black Dwarf</em>, is set in the Liddesdale hills, an area which
                Scott knew intimately from the time he had spent hunting ballads
                for his <a href="../poetry/minstrelsy.html"><i>Minstrelsy of
                the Scottish Border</i></a>. The plot itself draws on a number
                of Border Ballads. The adventures of Hobbie Elliot, the pillage
                of Heughfott, appeal to the Black Dwarf for help, gathering of
                forces, and the 'siege' of Westburnflat parallel events in the
                ballads 'Jamie Telfer of the Fair Dodhead' and 'The Fray of Support'.
                The extensive knowledge of Border history and lore acquired while
                compiling the <em>Minstrelsy</em> was further broadened by Scott's
                work on <em>The Border Antiquities of England and Scotland</em> (1814-17).
                The 'Black Dwarf' himself draws on Border folklore, in particular,
                legends of the 'Brown Man of the Moors'. There was also, however,
                as Scott himself acknowledged in the 'Magnum Opus' edition of <em>The
                Black Dwarf</em>, a human model: the reclusive David Ritchie,
                whose cottage Scott had visited while staying with his friend
                Captain Adam Ferguson in Peeblesshire, 1797.</p>
            <p align="left">Scott may well have started writing <em>The Black
                Dwarf</em> during his spring stay in Abbotsford, but progress
                was considerably slower than his publishers had been led to expect.
                Having been promised that the first volume would be in print
                within a month of the contract being signed, Blackwood issued
                an ultimatum on 31 July, forcing Scott to write and to release
                copy at a much swifter rate. The volume was in print by the end
                of August but pressure from his publishers may have led Scott
                to conclude too hurriedly. Certainly, having read the first 192
                pages with mounting excitement and assured John Murray (23 August
                1816) of 'the splendid merit of the work', William Blackwood
                felt that the finished article was marred by a weak ending. He
                asked James Ballantyne (who shared some of his disappointment)
                to forward to Scott suggestions for a revision which appear to
                have originated with William Gifford, Murray's literary adviser.
                Scott, incensed that Gifford had been consulted, refused to alter
                a word. Privately, however, Scott acknowledged the force of Blackwood's
                criticisms. He had begun the novel well, he wrote to Lady Louisa
                Stuart, 'but tired of the ground I had trode so often before
                I had walked over two thirds of the course. [...] So I quarrelled
                with my story, &amp; bungled up a conclusion as a boarding school
                Miss finishes a task which she had commenced with great glee &amp; accuracy'
                (letter of 14 November 1816).</p>
            <p align="left">Having completed <em>The Black Dwar</em>f, Scott
              turned to the 'tale of the West', <a href="mortality.html"><em>Old
              Mortality</em></a>. As this tale took hold of Scott's imagination,
              however, it expanded<i><em> </em></i>to fill the remaining three
              volumes of the <em>Tales of My Landlord</em>. The original scheme
              for the Tales was never carried out. Only <em>The Black Dwarf</em> was
              completed in accordance with the original plan of setting four
              tales in four separate regions. Complete in one volume, it remains
              something of an anomaly in Scott's production. It was published
              along with <i>Old Mortality</i> on December 2, 1816.</p>

            <i>The Black Dwarf</i> is set in the immediate aftermath of the Union
            between England and Scotland in 1707. The political action is centred
            on the first uprising to be attempted by Jacobites after the
            Union, the aborted landing of the exiled James Francis Edward Stuart
            and	a large French fleet in March 1708.
            <p>The dwarf of the title is Sir Edward Mauley, who, in his youth,
              has embraced the quarrel of his friend and kinsman Richard Vere,
              killing his rival the Laird of Earnscliff. While imprisoned for
              manslaughter, he learns that Vere has betrayed him by marrying
              his intended bride. He retires in misanthropical disgust to Mucklestane
              Moor, where his extraordinary strength, knowledge of medicine,
              and ready wealth lead the local people to regard him as a supernatural
              being in league with the Devil. Living incognito, he is known as
              Elshender the Recluse. Vere lives nearby with his daughter Isabella
              who has fallen in love with Earnscliff's son, Patrick. Vere opposes
              the union, and, in order to further his Jacobite schemes, forces
              Isabella to consent to marriage with Sir Frederick Langley. Isabella
              appeals to Mauley for assistance. As Vere's expenditures have brought
              his lands under Mauley's control, he is able to show Langley that
              Isabella is penniless without his consent, and the marriage is
              prevented at the last minute. The Jacobite plot is discovered,
              and Vere and Langley flee the country. Revealing his true identity,
              Mauley bestows his fortune upon Isabella who marries Patrick Earnscliff.
              Mauley disappears and his ultimate fate remains a mystery. </p>

            <p>For both critics and public, <i>The Black Dwarf</i> suffered by
              comparison with its companion piece <i>Old Mortality</i>. The <i>Critical
              Review </i>described it as a 'story possessing considerable capabilities'
              but marred by 'the multiplication of characters'. The <i>Monthly
              Review</i> felt that its interest lay only in the minor characters
              and that the primary plot was dull. The only positive notices appeared
              in the <i>Scots Magazine</i> and the <i>British Review</i>, for
              which <i>The Black Dwarf</i> was 'conducted with singular art,
              embracing much well sustained character and striking incident'.
              One of the novel's harshest critics was Scott himself who reviewed
              it anonymously in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, lamenting that the
              explanation of Mauley's conduct was 'too long delayed from an obvious
              wish to protract the mystery', and then dealt with so hastily as
              to be almost incomprehensible. Like the 'Author of <i>Waverley</i>''s
              other novels, the construction was slovenly and the hero uninteresting
              in character and inconsistent in behaviour. Despite its poor critical
              reception, <em>The Black Dwarf</em>, aided by the success of <em>Old
              Mortality</em>, appeared<em> </em>in five independent editions in under
              three years. </p>
