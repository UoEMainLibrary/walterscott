                <td width="51%"><i>Quentin Durward</i>, set in fifteenth-century France,
                  was Scott's first fictional venture onto the continent of Europe.
                  Scott's earliest reference to the novel occurs in a letter
                  of 10 November 1822 to the London-based actor and theatre manager
                  Daniel Terry. Terry, who had adapted a number of Scott's works
                  for the stage, was one of the select few in whom Scott had
                  confided his authorship of the Waverley Novels. Scott informs
                  Terry that he is planning a novel featuring a Scottish archer
                  in the France of Louis XI 'the most picturesque of all times'
                  (Letters, VII, 281). Two months later, on 11 January 1823,
                  he mentions the same idea in a letter to his friend J.B.S.
                  Morritt, 11 January 1823. As well as being 'an admirable little
                  corner of history', the new continental sitting will confound
                  'the vulgar dogs of imitators' busily exploring the avenues
                  of Scottish and British history in Scott's wake (Letters, VII,
                208).</td>

              </tr>
            </table>            <p align="left">Scott's idea may have been sparked by the recent
              return from France of his friend and fellow Advocate James Skene
              of Rubislaw, a talented amateur artist. Skene had kept a detailed
              journal of his tour with sketches of historical buildings and scenery.
              The journal was placed at Scott's disposition during the composition
              of <em>Quentin Durward</em> and exerted a demonstrable influence
              on a number of the descriptive passages. In the aftermath of the
              Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, Scott (whose <a href="../../biography/marriage.html">wife</a> was
              French) realized that there would be great public interest in the
              reign of Louis XI which saw the fall of feudal France and the emergence
              of the first modern centralized nation-state. The decision to make
              the hero a Scottish archer may have been influenced by Scott's
              own
              reinvention of the Company of Archers as the bodyguard for George
              IV during his visit to Edinburgh in August 1822.</p>
            <p align="left">Scott must have started writing <em>Quentin Durward</em> shortly
              after his letter to Morritt, as a letter of 23 January to Archibald
              Constable reveals that he was making good progress. Indeed, the
              whole novel was written at exceptional speed. The first two volumes
              were at the printers by 4 March. Progress slowed a little during
              late March and early April as Scott decided to reduce the historical
              scope of the novel and to keep material in reserve which would
              eventually be used six years later in <a href="geierstein.html"><em>Anne
              of Geierstein</em></a>. Scott was also deeply affected by the death
              in March of his brother Tom, leaving him, at the age of 52, as
              the only surviving offspring of a family of twelve boys and girls. <i></i></p>
            <p align="left">The note to <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
                Ballantyne</a> accompanying the final leaves of the manuscript
                is unfortunately undated but must have been sent before the end
                of April 1823. Ballantyne, however, prompted Scott to rework
                the conclusion of the novel which he felt was too abrupt. The
                revised
                text was
                complete by 3 May. Unusually, however, the title was kept secret
                until the printing was complete, with only chapter titles provided
                in the running heads. This was to prevent pirate editions being
                printed from proof-sheets as had happened with <a href="peak.html"><em>Peveril
                of the Peak</em></a> in the United States. Throughout its composition,
                Scott privately referred to the novel as <em>Durward</em>. Constable,
                however, persuaded Scott to use his hero's full name which he
                felt felicitously echoed<em> <a href="mannering.html">Guy
                Mannering</a>. </em>The new novel was published in London on
                17 May 1823 and in Edinburgh on 19 May, a mere fourth months
                after the appearance of <em>Peveril of the Peak</em>.</p>

            <p align="left"><em>Quentin Durward</em> portrays a power-struggle between
              the Duchy of Burgundy and the Holy Roman Empire for possession
              of the thriving merchant city of Li&egrave;ge in modern-day Belgium.
              It is set, however, in the wider context of Louis XI's efforts
              to establish the French monarchy as a centralizing force in a modern
              nation-state. The collapse of powerful feudal dominions sees the
              emergence of new trading classes but also the emergence of predatory
              local barons and decline of the spirit of chivalry. </p>
            <p align="left">By far Scott's most important historical source were
              the <em>M&eacute;moires</em> of Philippe de Commynes which are generally
              regarded as the first example of modern analytical history. Commynes
              had acted as a councillor to both Louis XI of France and Charles
              the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. His portrait of the former, which strongly
              influenced Scott's own, is notably more balanced than those offered
              by rival historians and chroniclers. Scott also drew on the on
              collection of French historical memoirs edited by Claude Bernard
              Petitot but was otherwise more interested in obtaining topographical
              works, maps, and gazetteers to supply the place of first-hand knowledge
              of the regions portrayed. In this he received much valuable aid
              from Archibald Constable's son David who was curator of the Advocates'
              Library. </p>

            <p align="left">The plot centres on the rivalry between Louis XI
              of France and Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Louis incites
              the citizens of Li&egrave;ge to revolt against Charles, and, under
              the command of Louis's ally, William De La Marck, they seize and
              murder Charles's brother-in-law, the Bishop of Li&egrave;ge. At
              the time of the murder Louis is at Charles's camp at Peronne, hoping
              to fool him with a false display of friendship. Charles, though,
              sees through his pretence, accuses him of instigating the uprising,
              and has him imprisoned. Louis's superior coolness of mind permits
              him to allay Charles's suspicions and to regain his liberty. In
              a sub-plot, the Burgundian heiress Isabelle de Croye takes refuge
              at Louis's court when Charles attempts to give her hand in marriage
              to his odious favourite Campo-Basso. Louis, in turn, resolves to
              give her in marriage to de la Marck, and sends her to Flanders
              under the pretence of placing her under the protection of the Bishop
              of Li&egrave;ge. She is guarded on her journey by Quentin Durward,
              an archer, who has left behind poverty in Scotland to join Louis's
              Scottish Guard. Quentin prevents the intended treachery and earns
              Isabelle's love. Charles, though, promises her in marriage to the
              Duke of Orleans (heir to the French crown) but she refuses, and,
              in anger, the Duke promises her to whoever brings him the head
              of De La Marck. This Quentin does with the help of his uncle, Ludovic
              Lesley, and wins Isabelle's hand.</p>

            <p>Scott completed <i>Quentin Durward</i> within five months of finishing <i>Peveril
                  of the Peak</i>, and readers had difficulty believing that
                  the 'Author of Waverley' could have produced another novel
                  quite so quickly. It was perhaps for this reason that sales
                  were initially slow despite <i>Quentin Durward</i> being Scott's
                  most critically acclaimed novel since <a href="ivanhoe.html"><i>Ivanhoe</i></a>.
                  Scott's expressed his disappointment in a letter: 'If it had
                  been a bad book I would not have cared, but we must think what
                  is to be done.'</p>
            <p>The slow sales of <i>Quentin Durward</i> in England stood in stark
              contrast to its reception in France, where it caused a similar
              sensation to<i> <a href="waverley.html">Waverley</a></i> in Scotland
              and <i>Ivanhoe</i> in England. French
              women adopted the fashion of wearing gowns in the Stuart tartan,
              and Scott became the talk of Paris. The vogue for the novel spread
              to Italy then swept across Europe, eventually awakening renewed
              interest in Britain, where demand soon outstripped supply.</p>
            <p>Critical reaction was mixed. The <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> judged
              it in point of story 'the most perfect of the Author's performances',
              and the <i>British Magazine</i> felt it displayed 'more talent
              than any other of the author's works'. For the <i>Scotsman</i>,
              however, it lacked the touches of genius which the poorest of its
              predecessors possessed. The <i>European Magazine</i> argued that
              the characters and situations were repeated from earlier novels,
              and the<i> Literary Chronicle</i> declared it the worst novel to
              date by the 'Author of Waverley'.</p>
