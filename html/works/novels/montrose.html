            <p align="left"><font size="2"><img src="graphics/cc44.gif" alt="Annot Lyle, coloured lithograph by M. O'Connor, 1833 (Corson P.2556)" width="173" height="216" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></font>The Third Series of <em>Tales of My Landlord</em>,
              consisted of two tales, <em><a href="lammermoor.html">The Bride
              of Lammermoor</a>,</em> which
              occupied the first two-and-a-half volumes, and the shorter <em>A
              Legend of Montrose</em>, which occupied the remainder of the
              third and the whole of the fourth volume. Having recovered from
              a near-fatal attack of gallstones, Scott had completed <em>The
              Bride of Lammermoor</em> by mid-April
              1819. Turning promptly to its companion piece, he had <em>A Legend
              of Montrose</em> fully typeset by 3 June. The
              rapidity of composition is all the more astonishing given that
              Scott was
              still in fragile health and dictated most of the manuscript to
              <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John Ballantyne</a> and
              to his factor William Laidlaw. It seems likely, however, that the
              plot had been mentally elaborated in advance. A
              letter
              from
              Archibald
              Constable to Robert Cadell dated
              15 June 1818 indicates that Scott
              was already thinking of a tale of the Montrose Wars (1639-45) while
              finishing work on <a href="midlothian.html"><em>The Heart of Mid-Lothian</em></a>.</p>
            <p align="left">The novel is set in Perthshire and Argyll. The central
              plot is loosely based on the murder of Lord Kilmont by James Stewart
              of
              Ardvoirlich
              after
               the battle 
              of Tippermuir, for which Scott's principal source was John Buchanan
              of Cambusmore. Further sources are the memoirs of the 17th-century
              mercenaries Col.
                  Robert Monro (who served during the Thirty Years' War under
              both Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adolphus
              of Sweden) and Sir James Turner (who fought for both the Covenanters
              and the Royalists). Scott chanelled key traits and episodes
              from both into one of his finest
              comic characters, Captain Dalgetty, the soldier of fortune.</p>
            <p align="left">In Scott's manuscript the novel is entitled <em>A
                Legend of the Wars of Montrose</em>. Neither Constable nor <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
                Ballantyne</a> approved the title, and Scott agreed to alter
                it to <em>A Legend of Montrose</em> despite his objection that Montrose
                did not himself figure prominently. The recent Edinburgh Edition
                of the novel (Edinburgh University Press, 1995), edited by J.H.
                Alexander, restores Scott's preferred title.</p>

                <p>The story takes place against the backdrop of the Royalist
                  Earl  of Montrose's Highland campaign against the Covenanters
                  in 1644. 
              Allan M'Aulay, a member of Montrose's army, has sworn vengeance
                   on the savage clan of Ranald MacEagh, known as the Children
                  of the 
              Mist, who have murdered his uncle and mistreated his mother. He
                   is in love with Annot Lyle whom he has rescued during a foray
                  against 
              the clan MacEagh. Annot, however, prefers Allan's intimate friend,
                   the Earl of Menteith, a fellow Royalist. The mystery of Annot's
                  
              birth holds both back from pressing their claims. Annot has been
                   kidnapped as a young child by MacEagh during the sacking of
                  her 
              father's castle, and recalls nothing of her family background.
                  Alarmed  at wild threats issued by the jealous Allan against
                  Menteith, Montrose 
              sends him away on a mission. When Allan finds and mortally wounds
                   MacEagh, the old cateran confesses that Annot is the daughter
                  of 
              Sir Duncan Campbell, the Knight of Ardenvohr, with whom she is
                  reunited.  As she is thus revealed to be a suitable match,
                  Annot is engaged 
              to Menteith, and plans are made for their wedding. On the appointed
                   day, Allan returns to the camp and stabs his successful rival
                  in 
              fulfilment of prophecy that has long tormented him. He evades capture
                   and, having disappeared, is variously rumoured to have been
                  killed 
              by the Children of the Mist or to have entered a monastery. Menteith
                   recovers from his wound and lives happily with Annot.</p>

            <h3><font color="#003366"><a name="reception" id="reception"></a>Reception</font></h3>
            <p>Published on June 21, 1819, <i>A Legend of Montrose</i> received
               markedly less critical notice than <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>,
                and has since remained in the shadow of its companion piece.
               The 
              <i>Edinburgh Monthly Review</i> and the <i>Scotsman </i>alone considered
               the novel at length. The former deplored the irreverent use of
              Scripture, 
              Scott's resort to the supernatural, and the apparent absence of
               any higher moral purpose. The latter was altogether more positive,
              
              even claiming that Scott was in some regards superior to Shakespeare.
               It detected, however, an anti-Presbyterian prejudice in the depiction
              
              of the Covenanting army and its general, the Marquis of Argyle,
               and accused Scott of whitewashing Montrose's reputation.</p>
