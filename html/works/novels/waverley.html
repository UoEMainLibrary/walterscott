            <p><img src="graphics/cc0417.jpg" alt="Edinburgh: March of the Highlanders, engraved by T. Higham after J.M.W. Turner (Corson P.3613)" width="331" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Scott's own account of the composition of <em>Waverley</em> is
              well-known but has been increasingly questioned in recent scholarship.
              According to the General Preface (1829) to the 'Magnum Opus' edition
              of the Waverley Novels, he began work on the novel 'about the year
              1805'. Inspired by tales that he had heard from veterans of the
              '45 and by his own youthful travels in the Highlands, he saw the
              fictional potential of a clash of cultures, he felt sure that 'the
              ancient traditions and high spirit of a people who, living in a
              civilized age and country, retained so strong a tincture of manners
              belonging to an early period of society must afford a subject favorable
              for romance'. Having written some seven chapters, he asked his
              friend William Erskine for his opinion. This being unfavourable,
              Scott was reluctant to risk his reputation as poet by proceeding
              any further, and set the manuscript aside. In September 1810 he
              turned to <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James Ballantyne</a> for
              a second opinion on the fragment. Although broadly appreciative,
              Ballantyne's approval was too moderate to persuade Scott to resume
              his narrative. <i>Waverley</i> then lay forgotten in a drawer until
              autumn 1813 when Scott happened upon the manuscript while rummaging
              for fishing tackle. Rereading it, his faith in the story was rekindled,
              and he resolved to complete it. </p>
            <p align="left">Recent scholars have queried Scott's chronology in
              light of strong textual and circumstantial evidence that Scott
              was actively engaged with the novel over the period 1808-10. For
              Claire Lamont (1981) and Jane Millgate (1984), this consitutes
              an intermediate phase between the two stages posited by Scott (1805
              and 1813-14) (see <a href="../bibliography.html">Bibliography</a>).
              Peter D. Garside (1986), however, finds little compelling evidence
              that the novel was begun c1805 and is inclined to bring forward
              its genesis to the 1808-10 period. He notes that Longmans advertised
              the novel as a forthcoming publication as early as August 1810.
              There are similarities both in the paper used and in the narrative
              content between the opening chapters of <em>Waverley</em> and Scott's
              Ashestiel <em>Memoirs</em> (1808-11). There are also close textual
              and thematic parallels with <a href="../poetry/lady.html"><em>The
              Lady of the Lake</em></a> (1810). Garside observes that the fashionable
              modes of fiction parodied in Chapter I of <em>Waverley</em> --
              novels of scandal and sentiment -- were at their height between
              1807 and 1810 but fit ill with an 1805 genesis. The prevailing
              literary climate would also have appeared more favourable to an
              experiment with a tale of national or regional manners following
              the success of Maria Edgeworth's <em>Tales of Fashionable Life</em> (1809),
              Elizabeth Hamilton's <em>Cottagers of Glenburnie</em> (1808), and,
              in particular, Jane Porter's <em>The Scottish Chiefs</em> (1810).
              1810, finally, was the date of a trip to the Highlands and Western
              Isles, described in Scott's Letters in terms reminiscent of the
              early Highland scenes of <em>Waverley</em>. In Garside's hypothesis,
              much of the first volume of <em>Waverley</em> was complete by 1810.
              Work on the novel was suspended by the time-consuming and expensive
              move to <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> in
              1811. The consequent need to raise ready cash led Scott to return
              to the more lucrative poetry market with <a href="../poetry/rokeby.html"><em>Rokeby</em></a> (1813).
              It was the relative failure of <em>Rokeby</em> that led Scott to
            resume work on <em>Waverley</em> in late 1813.</p>            </td>

              Lockhart's claim that the first volume was completed over the
              Christmas vacation of 1813-14. In order to preserve his anonymity,
              Scott asked <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John Ballantyne</a> to
                    copy the manuscript out in his own hand before sending the
                    first volume to press. Once printed, John Ballantyne showed
                    it to Archibald Constable who immediately recognized that
                    the work was Scott's and offered the exceptional sum of &pound;700
                    for the copyright. Scott replied that the sum was excessive
                    should the novel fail and inadequate should it succeed. It
                    was resolved that publisher and author should share the profits
              equally, a settlement that Constable would come to regret. </p>
            <p align="left">Work on <i>Waverley</i> was delayed by Scott's
                    efforts to resolve his financial affairs (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html#1813">Financial
                    hardship</a>), by negotiations with Constable over Scott's
                    last major poetic work <i><a href="../poetry/lord.html">The
                    Lord of the Isles</a></i>, and by work on Abbotsford.
                    Settling down to complete the novel in June 1814, Scott wrote
                    the second and third volumes in an extraordinary three-week
                    burst. Completed on 1 July, <i>Waverley</i> was rushed through
                    the press and published on 7 July, a few weeks before Scott's
                    43rd birthday. Once again, the manuscript had been copied
                    out in John Ballantyne's hand to preserve Scott's incognito,
                    and the novel was published anonymously with only Scott's
                    closeset associates being let into the secret. (For the factors
                    that may have led Scott to preserve his anonymity, see <a href="../../biography/novel.html">Scott

                  <p><i>Waverley</i> is set during the Jacobite Rebellion of
                      1745, which sought to restore the Stuart dynasty in the
                    person of Charles Edward Stuart (or 'Bonnie Prince Charlie').
                    The
                      hero is a young Englishman, Edward Waverley. Neglected
                    by his pro-Hanoverian father, Edward is brought up by his
                    elderly
                      uncle, the Jacobite-leaning Sir Everard Waverley. Like
                    Scott himself, Edward reads widely in poetry and romance
                    as a child,
                      creating an imaginary world that he much prefers to a lacklustre
                      present. Having obtained a commission in the army, he is
                      sent to Scotland in 1745. During a spell of leave, he visits
                      his uncle's friend and fellow Jacobite, the Baron of Bradwardine
                      at Tully-Veolan, forming an attachment to his daughter
                    Rose. A spirit of adventure now leads him to visit the lair
                    of
                      Donald Bean Lean, a Highland freebooter, and the great
                    hall at Glennaquoich, home to Fergus MacIvor, a young Highland
                      chieftain and ardent Jacobite. Here Edward witnesses a
                    patriarchal
                      society where chieftain and follower feast together united
                      by ties of kinship. Edward's romantic sensibilities are
                    deeply affected by their fanatical enthusiasm for the Jacobite
                    cause,
                      particularly when embodied in Fergus's beautiful sister
                    Flora. The frequentation of known Jacobites compromises Edward
                    with
                      his regiment, leading ultimately to his dismissal and arrest.
                      Rescued by Rose, Edward joins the Jacobite forces even
                    though reason tells him that Charles Edward Stuart's attempt
                    to
                      capture the British throne is doomed to failure. He is
                    captivated by the personal charm of the Prince, impressed
                    by Flora's devotion, and coerced by the powerful personality
                    of Fergus
                      MacIvor. However, when the Jacobite cause fails, Waverley
                      is forced into hiding and is only freed when General Talbot,
                      whose life he has saved at the Battle of Prestonpans, grants
                      him a pardon. After attending the trial and condemnation
                      of Fergus, Edward is decisively rejected by Flora. He then
                      marries the placid Rose Bradwardine, who represents the
                    rational, realistic present of post-Union Scotland as opposed
                    to the
                      colourful, passionate past personified by Flora.</p>

                  <p>The success of <i>Waverley</i> was phenomenal and
                      established Scott as a novelist with an international reputation.
                      The
                      first edition of one thousand copies sold out within two
                      days of publication, and by November a fourth edition was
                      at the presses. The critics too were almost unanimously
                    enthusiastic. The fullest and most perceptive analysis was
                    provided by
                      Francis Jeffrey in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. In Jeffrey's
                      view, <i>Waverley</i> cast 'the whole tribe of ordinary
                      novels into the shade'. The secret of the author's success
                      lay in
                      his truth to nature 'even in the most marvellous parts
                      of his story'. Such were his powers of observation and
                      fidelity
                      to 'actual experience' that the reader saw in the novel
                      'an instructive exposition of human actions and energies'
                      rather
                      than 'a bewildering series of dreams and exaggerations'. <i>Waverley</i>'s
                      faults, deriving from a creaking, hastily constructed plot,
                      were redeemed by the force of its characterization and
                      vividness of its descriptive passages. </p>
                  <p>Other journals echoed Jeffrey's praise, further complimenting
                    the author on his easy flowing style and knowledge of the
                    past. Only one reviewer, John Wilson Croker for the <i>Quarterly
                    Review</i>, expressed substantial reservations, objecting
                    to the obscurity of the Scots dialogue, historical inaccuracies,
                    and the very mixture of history and 'romance'. Despite Scott's
                    efforts to preserve his anonymity, almost every reviewer
                    guessed that <i>Waverley</i> was his work. Many readers too
                    recognized his hand. One, Jane Austen, wrote: 'Walter Scott
                    has no business to write novels, especially good ones. --
                    It is not fair. He has Fame and Profit enough as a Poet,
                    and should not be taking the bread out of other people's
                    mouths.-- I do not like him, and do not mean to like <i>Waverley</i> if
                    I can help it -- but fear I must' (letter to Anna Austen
                    of 28 September 1814).</p>
