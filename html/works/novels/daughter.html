            <p align="left"><img src="../../graphics/daughter.jpg" alt="Menie Gray, engraved by Robert Graves after Frank Stone, 1833 (Corson P.1831)" width="186" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">As
              acknowledged in the 'Magnum Opus' edition of <em>Chronicles of
              the Canongate</em> (1831), 'The
              Surgeon's Daughter' was inspired by an anecdote related to Scott
              one morning by Joseph
              Train,
              Gallowegian
              excise
              officer and antiquarian, who also supplied material for <a href="mannering.html"><em>Guy
              Mannering</em></a>,
              <a href="mortality.html"><em>Old Mortality</em></a>, and <a href="redgaun.html"><em>Redgauntlet</em></a>.
              Train's narrative, a version of which he submitted for the 'Magnum
              Opus' edition, involved an unscrupulous adventurer who tricks a
              surgeon's daughter into travelling to India so that he might hand
              her over to an Indian prince.
              It has not
              to date been established whether Train's anecdote derives from
              a true story.</p>
            <p align="left">Although Scott never travelled to India, he had strong
              Indian connections. His brother Robert died young while serving
              in the East India Company. His uncle Colonel William Russell
              of Ashestiel
              served
              with both the East India Company and the army in Madras.
              His cousin
              James
              Russell was born in India and served in the Madras Native Cavalry.
              His brother-in-law Charles Carpenter was 'commercial resident'
              at Salem in South India. Many of Scott's childhood neighbours in
              <a href="../../biography/homes.html">George Square</a>, Edinburgh, had Indian connections, as did his Border
              friend
              and fellow ballad-collector John Leyden. </p>
            <p align="left">Scott's most significant source, however, was Colonel
              James Ferguson (1778-1859), the
              younger brother of one of Scott's closest friends Sir Adam Ferguson.
              Ferguson returned to Scotland in 1823, after spending twenty-five
              years in India, and came to live with his two sisters at Huntlyburn
              on Scott's <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> estate.
              As he worked on 'The Surgeon's Daughter', Scott felt increasingly
              hampered by his lack of first-hand knowledge of Indian life. As
              he wrote in his <em>Journal</em> (22 August 1827), the tale required
              'a small seasoning of curry powder'. He turned to Colonel Ferguson
              who obliged him with written sketches of Indian manners, ceremony,
              and protocol and with advice on Anglo-Indian language. Some of
              Ferguson's material is reproduced almost verbatim in 'The Surgeon's
              Daughter'.
              It is from Ferguson too that Scott derives the punishment of death
              by elephant that is inflicted on Richard Middlemass.</p>
            <p align="left">Scott also drew extensively on published sources,
              particularly Robert Orme's <em>History of the</em> <em>Military
              Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan, from the Year MDCCXLV</em>              (1763-78).
              Also important were <em>Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James
              Scurry: Who Was Detained a Prisoner during Ten Years, in the Dominions
              of Hyder
              Ali and
              Tippoo Saib</em> (1824) and <em>Narrative Sketches of the Conquest
              of the Mysore, Effected by the British Troops and their Allies,
              in
              the
              Capture
              of Seringapatam, and the Death of Tippoo Sultaun</em> (1800).</p>

            <p align="left"><img src="graphics/tipoo.jpg" alt="Hyder Ali, engraved by Keck after W. Dickes, 185-? (Corson P.556)" width="189" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">'The
              Surgeon's Daughter' is set in the mid- to late 1770s between the
              First and Second Mysore Wars. It is the story of Menie Gray,
              daughter of Dr Gideon Gray (who is thought to have been modelled
              on Scott's own doctor, Ebenezer Clarkson
            of Selkirk). Menie falls in love
              with
              Richard
              Middlemas,
              an
              illegitimate
              
              child brought up in the surgeon's household. Richard has been educated
               to the medical profession, and the couple are betrothed with the
              
              blessings of Menie's father. Scorning his prospects as a country
               doctor, however, Richard leaves Scotland to seek his fortune in
              India. Here 
              he becomes the paramour of an adventuress Adela Montreville who
               concocts a plot to lure Menie to India and hand her over to the
              Vice-Regent 
              of Bangalore, Prince Tippoo Saib (whose passions have been aroused
               by a picture of the young girl). Bribery and hope of advancement
              
              lead Richard to go along with the scheme, and Menie, who has been
               reduced to poverty following her father's death, answers Richard's
              
              call to join her in India as his wife. The hero of the story turns
               out to be Adam Hartley, a student friend of Richard's and his
              unsuccessful 
              rival for Menie's hand. Adam secures the help of Hyder Ali, Tippoo
               Saib's father, who assures Menie's safety and punishes Richard
              by 
              having him crushed to death by an elephant. Shortly afterwards,
               Adam contracts a fatal disease leaving Menie as his principal
              heir. 
            Out of respect for his memory, she remains unmarried.</p>
