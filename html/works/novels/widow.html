              Croftangry, the
              fictional editor of the <em>Chronicles</em>, claims to be publishing
              a memorandum from his friend Mrs Martha Bethune
              Baliol. While making a tour of the Highlands nearly forty years
              previously, the young Mrs Bethune Baliol had met the 'Highland
              Widow' and heard her tale. Mrs Bethune Baliol is modelled on
              Mrs Anne Murray Keith, a friend of Scott's maternal aunt Christian
              Rutherford, and, according to the 'Magnum Opus' edition of the <em>Chronicles</em>              (1831),
              the genuine source of the tale. Although there is no reason to
              doubt that Scott first heard the tale from Mrs Murray Keith's lips,
              a version of it was also told in Sir John Carr's
              <em>Caledonian Sketches, or, A Tour through Scotland in 1807</em> (1809),
              a work that Scott reviewed for the <em>Quarterly
              Review</em>. The title was suggested by 'The
              Highland Widow's Lament', a Jacobite lament in which the singer
              relates her sufferings since her husband's death at Culloden.
              The 'Lament' was contributed to James Johnson's <em>Scots Musical
              Museum</em> in
              1796 by Robert Burns who is thought to have written part of it
              himself. MacTavish Mhor, the widow's late husband in Scott's tale,
              is largely modelled on Rob Roy Macgregor (see <a href="robroy.html"><em>Rob
              Roy</em></a>).</p>

            <p align="left">The tale takes place on the banks of the River Awe
              in Argyllshire during  the Seven Years War (1756-63). The
              heroine is Elspat MacTavish, 
              the widow of MacTavish Mhor, one of the last of the Highland caterans
               ('marauders'), shot as a Jacobite after the battle of Culloden
              in 
              1745. She lives alone with her son, Hamish Bean MacTavish, hoping
               that he will grow up to revive his father's way of life. Hamish,
              
              however, realizes that in changed times the only honourable way
               he can imitate his father's courage and sense of adventure is
              by 
              joining a government regiment destined for America. When Hamish
               visits his mother on a furlough, the incensed Elspat drugs him
              so 
              that he sleeps beyond his leave of absence, hoping that he will
               escape with her and lead the life of a cateran rather than be
              branded 
              a deserter. Instead he awaits his fate but is goaded by his mother
               into killing the officer sent to arrest her. Hamish is tried and
              
              executed; Elspat devotes the rest of her life to mourning and remorse
            before disappearing to die in solitude.</p>
