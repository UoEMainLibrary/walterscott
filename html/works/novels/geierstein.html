			<p><img src="graphics/0007335d.jpg" alt="Anne of Geierstein &amp; Arthur Philipson, engraved by William Henry Capone after Francis William Topham, 1838 (Corson P.3709)" width="205" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">When Scott began work on <em>Anne of Geierstein</em> in March 1828,
			  the novel had already been gestating in his mind for five years.
			  Upon completing
			  <em><a href="durward.html">Quentin Durward</a></em>, his tale of fifteenth-century
			  France<em>, </em>in
			  May 1823, Scott raised the possibility of a sequel in a letter
			  to <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
			  Ballantyne</a>. His original idea was to focus once again on the rivalry
			  between Louis IX of France and
			  Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Over time, however, Scott's
			  imagination came to focus on the disastrous (and ultimately fatal)
			  campaign waged by Charles the Bold against the Swiss Confederates.
			  It was
			  not until
			  August 1827, when Scott had just completed <em><a href="canongate.html">Chronicles
			  of the Canongate</a></em><a href="canongate.html">,
			  First Series</a>, that Scott's ideas began to take solid form. On 2
			  August, a letter from his publisher Robert Cadell
			  urged Scott to attempt a continuation of <em>Quentin Durward</em>, a theme
			  which 'could not fail to be popular'. Replying on 6 August,
			  Scott promised that he would give the proposal
			  'careful consideration'. Well-versed in French and Burgundian history,
			  Scott was considerably less confident on Swiss ground and asked
			  Cadell to procure relevant works for him. Cadell promptly did so,
			  but Scott turned instead to a Second Series
			  of <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em> consisting of <a href="fairmaid.html"><em>The
			  Fair Maid of Perth</em></a> and
			  the rejected tales later published as the 'Keepsake Stories'. Upon
			  completion of the <em>Fair Maid</em> in March 1828, it was agreed that Scott
			  would now press
			  on with the <em>Quentin</em> sequel. It was hoped that it would
			  generate sufficient funds to cover the considerable advances required
			  for the illustrated 'Magnum Opus' edition of the Waverley Novels,
			  the publishing scheme by which both Scott and Cadell hoped to repair
			  their fortunes (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html#1826">The Fall
			  of Archibald Constable and Co.</a>).</p>
			<p>Scott was unable to start immediately. In April and May he was in London
			  on business, and in June and July at work on the Second Series
			  of <a href="../prose/grandfather.html"><em>Tales of a Grandfather</em></a>.
			  On 6 July, however, his <em>Journal</em> records that he is reading the
			  historical and descriptive works on Switzerland sent by Cadell
			  the previous year. Composition had still not begun by August but
		  on the 6th of that month,
		  a letter to Cadell reveals that he is busy working out the plot of
		  the novel in advance. He tells Cadell of his plan to introduce the
			  Femgericht or Vehmgericht ('Secret Tribunal') of Medieval Germany,
			  a theme with which Scott had been familiar since his discovery
			  of German literature in the 1790s (see <a href="#sources">Sources</a>).
			  Scott finally appears to have begun writing in mid-September
			   but almost immediately encountered stern criticism of the opening
			  sequences from James Ballantyne. Even before composition began,
			  Ballantyne had expressed concerns about Scott's ability to evoke
			  a landscape that he had never visited. Scott had retorted that
			  'If I have not
			  seen the Alps I have seen Salva[tore] Rosa's pictures of the Apennines
			  which will do as well'
			  (letter of 25 August 1828). Ballantyne felt, however, that the
			  first proofs bore out his fears. Scott was sufficiently shaken
			  by his comments to lay aside the narrative for a few days. By 15
			  October, however, he was back at work, having, once again, persuaded
			  himself that his lack of first-hand knowledge of Switzerland was
			  no insurmountable barrier. 'Had I not', he asked John Gibson Lockhart,
			  'the honour of an intimate personal
			    acquaintance with every pass in the Highlands; and if that were
			    not enough had I not seen pictures and prints <em>galore</em>?' (letter
			    of 16 October). Scott pressed ahead, completing the first volume
			    by the end of November and making good progress on the second
		    in December.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
			<p> In January 1829, however, Scott suffered a bad case of writer's block,
			  recording, for example, in his <em>Journal </em>for 11
			  January: 'I did not write above a page yesterday; most weary, stale
			  and unprofitable have been my labours'. His efforts to breathe
			  life into his novel were constantly thwarted by 'a perplexing
			    sinking of the heart which one cannot always overcome'. A breakthrough
			      finally permitted Scott to complete the second
			      volume by 5 February, but he felt no 'great confidence that
			  it will please' (letter to J.B.S. Morritt). Progress was initially
			      brisk on the third and final volume but by 25 February his
			       <em>Journal</em> records serious concerns about the novel's ending
			       which he feared would be marred by an excess of historical
			       detail. Scott's confidence was further dented by more stinging
			       criticism from James Ballantyne received by post on 8 March.
			       Scott once again laid aside his manuscript and threw himself
			       into a lengthy review of Patrick Fraser Tytler's <em>History of
			       Scotland</em> for the<em> Quarterly Review</em>. A letter from Robert
			       Cadell on 19 March reconciled him to his novel. Cadell thought
			       Ballantyne's criticisms excessive and judged that it would
			       be sufficient to excise a lengthy digression on troubadours.
			       Scott re-read the last pages of his manuscript and found it
			       'not so bad after all though I fear it will not be popular' <em>(Journal</em>,
			       13 April). He resumed work the next day and by 16 April he
			  estimated that the novel was within a week of completion. With
			  typical perversity, he again put it aside until 27 April in order
			  to write a <em>History
			  of Scotland</em>. <em>Anne of Geierstein</em> was
			  finally completed on 29 April 1829. It was published in Edinburgh
			  on 20 May and in London on 25 May.</p>

			<p align="left"><em>Anne of Geierstein</em> begins in autumn 1474 and ends
			  in January 1477 with the defeat of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy
			  at the
			  Battle of Nancy. <em>Quentin Durward</em> had dramatized the conflict
			  between Louis XI of France and Charles the Bold, the former intent
			  on centralizing power, the latter a representative of the old
			  feudal system where lords essentially wielded independent power
			  over their dominions. Set in 1468, it had left the conflict largely
			  unresolved. Now, in <em>Anne of Geierstein</em>, Scott concentrated on Charles's
			  downfall
			  and the contribution of
			  the Swiss Confederates to his
			  defeat. Louis XI remains in the background manipulating events. </p>

			  source was the <em>M&eacute;moires</em> of
			  Philippe de Commynes who acted as a councillor
		  to both Louis and Charles. For basic information on Swiss history and
			  society Scott drew on four works sent to him by Cadell :
			  Grattan's <em>The History of Switzerland: From the Conquests
			  of Caesar to the Abdication of Buonaparte</em> (1825; largely an abridgement
			  of Joseph Planta's <em>The History of the Helvetic Confederacy</em>),
			  Louis Simond's <em>Switzerland, or, A Journal of a Tour and Residence
			  in that Country, in the Years 1817,1818, and 1819</em>, a French translation
			  of Johannes von M&uuml;ller's
			  <em>Die Geschichten der Schweizer</em>  (1780),
			  and A. Yosy's <em>Switzerland </em>(1815). He may also have consulted  a
			  French translation of Johann Heinrich Daniel Zschokke's <i>Geschichte
			  vom Kamp und Untergang der schweizerischen Berg- und Waldkantone </i>(1801).
			  For
			  Provence, Scott used Jean-Pierre Papon's <em>Histoire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
			  de Provence</em> (1777-86) and Anne Plumptre&#8217;s <em>Narrative of a
			  Three Years&#8217; Residence
		  in France</em> (1810). For Burgundy, he may have consulted Barante's recent <em>Histoire
		  des Ducs de Bourgogne</em> (1824-28).</p>
			<p align="left">For the French scenes, Scott also drew freely on the travel
			  journals and water-colour sketches of his close friend James Skene
			  of Rubislaw. Skene was a source too for Scott's depiction of the
			  Vehmgericht via a paper he had read to the Society of Antiquaries
			  of Scotland in 1824. Scott asked Skene for a copy of his paper
			  and was obviously struck by Skene's (contentious) description of
			  the Tribunal's underground chambers at Baden and the shaft down
			  which the accused were lowered for trial. Scott, though, had first
			  read of the Vehmgericht in the 1790s where it featured prominently
			  in a number of the new German works of literature which so excited
			  Scott and his friends. These included Goethe's
			  <em>G&ouml;tz von Berlichingen</em>			  which Scott translated
			  in 1799 (see <a href="../../biography/beginning.html">Literary
			  Beginnings</a>) and Christiane Benedicte Eugenie Naubert's <em>Hermann von
			  Unna</em>			  and <em>Alf von Dulemen</em> (both translated into English
			  in 1794). Scott himself had sought to contribute to the popularity
			  of the theme
			  with his 1797 drama <em>The House
			  of Aspen</em> (loosely based on Veit Weber's
			  <em>Die Heilige Vehme</em>) but it remained unperformed and unpublished
			  until 1830. While working on Anne of Geierstein, Scott updated
			  his knowledge of the Vehmgericht with solid historical reading
			  including Carl Philipp Kopp's <em>&Uuml;ber
			  die Verfassung der heimlichen Gerichte in Westphalen</em> (1794), Fran&ccedil;ois
			  Adolphe Lo&egrave;ve-Veimars's <em>Pr&eacute;cis de l&#8217;histoire des
			  tribunaux secrets, dans le nord de l&#8217;Allemagne</em> (1824), and Paul
			  Wigand's <em>Das Femgericht Westphalens </em>(1825).</p>

			<h3><font color="#003366"><a name="synopsis" id="synopsis"></a>Synopsis</font></h3>
			<p>The novel is set shortly after the battle of Tewkesbury (1471), 
                in which the Yorkist king Edward IV had finally defeated the
			  Lancastrian party. Two exiled Lancastrians, John de Vere, the Earl
			  of Oxford and his son, Arthur, are travelling through Switzerland
			  disguised as merchants and under the assumed name of Philipson.
			  Carrying the diamond necklace of Margaret of Anjou, they are on
			  a mission to
                convert Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, to the Lancastrian
			  cause. Caught by a storm in the mountains, they find refuge in
			  the home of Arnold Biederman, chief magistrate of Unterwalden.
			  Biederman
			  has relinquished his hereditary title of Count of Geierstein in
                favour of his brother Albert. His niece, the young Countess Anne,
			  lives under his protection, and rescues Arthur from death when
			  attacked
                by vertigo on an Alpine ledge. She and Arthur fall in love but,
			  fearing family opposition, Anne treats him with reserve. Biederman
                too has business with Charles the Bold as part of a delegation
			  sent to protest against the treatment the Swiss have received at
			  his hands. The Philipsons and Biederman set out in company but
			  are seized and imprisoned by Archibald of Hagenbach, employed by
			  Charles
			  the Bold as governor of the citadel of Brisach. They are saved
			  from
                death only when the citizens of Brisach rebel against their oppressor
			  and de Hagenbach is executed by order of the Vehmgericht (Secret
                Tribunal). After the party finally reaches the Duke's court,
			  the plot chiefly concerns the Earl of Oxford's efforts to win Charles
                the Bold's support for Margaret of Anjou and Lancaster. The negotiations
			  are interrupted by the Duke's disastrous military campaign against
                the Swiss (whose overtures he has rejected) and his eventual
                death and defeat at the battle of Nancy. The Philipsons/de Veres
                return
                to Geierstein, where marriage is celebrated between Arthur and
                Anne. </p>

			<h3><font color="#003366"><a name="reception" id="reception"></a>Reception</font></h3>
			<p>Both Ballantyne and Scott had serious doubts about <i>Anne of Geierstein</i> 
              and were therefore pleasantly surprised to find that the novel sold 
              well especially in England. Along with <a href="fairmaid.html"><i>The 
              Fair Maid of Perth</i></a><i>, Anne of Geierstein</i> was Scott's 
              most commercially successful novel after 1825. The reviews too were, 
              on the whole, highly favourable but some journals (notably the <i>Edinburgh 
              Literary Gazette</i>, the <i>Examiner</i>, and the <i>Westminster 
              Review</i>) felt that the factual elements of the plot were much 
              more interesting than the purely fictional, and that the attempt 
            to blend romance and history was, in this case, unsuccessful.</p>
