            <p align="left"><img src="graphics/cc84.gif" alt="Detail from the title page of Souvenir of Ravenswood by Henry Charles Merivale, 1890 (Corson A.18.2.2.BRI.MER.)" width="166" height="230" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The
              Third Series of <em>Tales of My Landlord</em>, consisted of two
              tales, <em>The Bride of Lammermoor,</em> which occupied the first
              two-and-a-half volumes, and the shorter <em><a href="montrose.html">A
              Legend of Montrose</a></em>, which occupied the remainder of the
              third and the whole of the fourth volume. The account of the composition
              of <em>The Bride of Lammermoor</em> in J.G. Lockhart's <em>Memoirs
              of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> (1837-38), has gained
              wide currency. Lockhart relates that Scott had suffered from excruciating
              stomach cramps while working on the novel. He quotes <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
              Ballantyne</a> as declaring that the entire novel had been dictated
              by Scott from his sickbed. It had been published before his full
              recovery and, according to Lockhart, Scott had been too ill to
              correct the proofs. Ballantyne is again quoted as stating that
              Scott had been in such distress during his illness, that, when
              his health improved and he read <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>,
              he 'did not recollect one single incident, character, or conversation
              it contained'. When asked whether he liked it, Scott replied: `As
              a whole, I felt it monstrous gross and grotesque; but still the
              worst of it made me laugh, and I trusted the good-natured public
              would not be less indulgent.' Lockhart's account has led some to
              approach <em>The Bride</em> as an example of automatic writing.
              There is compelling evidence, however, that it is largely a piece
              of Romantic myth-making. Most of the manuscript survives in Scott's
              hand, as do his corrected proofs. Only the final chapters of the
              manuscript were clearly dictated. </p>
            <p align="left">Relatively little evidence has survived indicating
              the exact period of composition for <em>The Bride of Lammermoor</em>.
              The Third Series of <em>Tales of My Landlord</em> are first mentioned
              in a letter to Archibald Constable on 3 September 1818, where Scott
              indicates that he has already begun work on the first tale. By
              November, however, progress had become painfully slow. Scott was
              beset by visitors at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>,
              and was beginning to doubt whether he could tell the tale as effectively
              as his mother related the historical episode which inspired it
              'in her quarter of an hour's crack by the fireside' (letter to
              James Ballantyne, 10 September 1818). In March 1819, Scott suffered
              a near-fatal attack of gallstones. He resumed work around 8 April,
              and as the manuscript indicates, dictated the final chapters. As
              the rest of the manuscript is in Scott's hand, he must have made
              good progress over the winter. Correspondence indicates that the
              novel was complete by the middle of April. Scott had finished writing
              the second tale, <em>A Legend of Montrose</em>, by the end of May,
              and <em>Tales of My Landlord</em>, Third Series, were published
              in Edinburgh on 21 June and London on 26 June. </p>

            <p align="left">The <em>Bride of Lammermoor</em> is based on a real-life
              family tragedy that Scott had heard as a boy from his maternal
              great-aunt Margaret Swinton and which became one of his mother's
              favourite fireside tales. Scott's heroine Lucy Ashton, derives
              from Janet Dalrymple, daughter of the great jurist James Dalrymple,
              first Viscount Stair. The Stairs were a landowning family sympathetic
              to the Covenanters, but Janet become secretly engaged to the Royalist
              third Lord Rutherford. She was compelled to confess the engagement
              when presented with a suitor approved by her parents and forced
              by a despotic mother to retract her vow. On the night of her marriage
              to her parent's approved choice, she seriously wounded her bridegroom
              in a fit of insanity and died a fortnight later without recovering
              her senses. Besides oral sources, Scott would have been familiar
              with written accounts of the episode in Robert Law's <em>Memorialls</em> and
              Sir William Hamilton of Whitelaw's 'Satyre on the Familie of Stairs',
              both of which add a supernatural element to the story. </p>
            <p align="left">Scott transfers an event which took place in 1669
              to the years immediately preceding the Union of Scotland and England
              in 1707. The tragedy of Lucy Ashton unfolds against the persistent
              threat of a French-backed Jacobite uprising and the absence of
              effective government in Scotland. The geographical setting is transferred
              from the West of Scotland to the Eastern Borders. Various Berwickshire
              locations have been proposed as settings for the novel but none
              convincingly.</p>

            <p>The novel's hero, Edgar, the Master of Ravenswood, inherits his
              father's hatred of Sir William Ashton, whom both blame for their
              family's ruin. The Ravenswoods have been stripped of their title
              following the Glorious Revolution and have subsequently lost their
              estate to Sir William, as a result of legal machinations, retaining
              only the dismal tower of Wolf's Crag. Inadvertently, however, Edgar
              saves the life of Sir William's daughter Lucy, and both fall deeply
              in love. A changing political climate leads Sir William to make
              his peace with Edgar. He looks favourably upon his attachment to
              Lucy, and the couple become secretly engaged. But when Lucy's despotic
              mother, Lady Ashton, arrives on the scene, she forbids all correspondence
              between the youngsters, and favours the suit of the Laird of Bucklaw,
              a political and personal enemy of Ravenswood. Put under severe
              pressure, Lucy agrees to marry Bucklaw but insists on writing to
              Edgar asking him to release her from her pledge. Lady Ashton intercepts
              the letter, and Lucy, assuming that Ravenswood is now indifferent
              to her, despairingly fixes the wedding day. Barely has the ceremony
              been performed, however, that Ravenswood appears and challenges
              Lucy's brother and new husband to combat. In that same night Lucy
              stabs and seriously wounds Bucklaw. She is found in convulsions
              and dies shortly afterwards without recovering her sanity. Further
              tragedy occurs when Ravenswood perishes in quicksand (in fulfilment
              of a prophecy) while riding to meet his antagonists.</p>

            <p align="left">Sales of the Third Series of <em>Tales of My Landlord</em> were
              initially disappointing. On 13 August Constable expressed regret
              that it had been published too late in the season. <i>The Bride
              of Lammermoor</i> went on, however, to enjoy long-standing popular
              success. Scott's correspondent Lady Louisa Stuart spoke for many
              readers in calling Ravenswood 'perhaps the best <i>lover</i> the
              author ever yet drew' (letter of 11 August 1819). Critical response
              was mixed. The <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> and <i>Blackwood's</i> were
              highly complimentary, the latter declaring the novel 'a pure and
              magnificent tragic romance'. As Scott had feared, however, other
              journals found the conclusion too gloomy and the characters' fates
              unjust. </p>
