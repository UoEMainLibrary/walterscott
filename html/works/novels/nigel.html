                <td width="66%">Almost immediately after completing <a href="pirate.html"><i>The
                      Pirate</i></a> in October 1821, Scott began working on <i>The
                      Fortunes of Nigel</i>, set in the reign of King James VI
                      and I, whose 'rare mixture of sense and nonsense, pedantry
                      and childishness, wit and folly' he thought had long merited
                      literary treatment (letter to Constable, 30 September,
                      1821). He finished the first volume before the Christmas
                      holidays, putting to use his intimate knowledge of Ben
                      Jonson and other Stuart dramatists along with decades of
                      extensive reading into the period<i></i>. In addition,
                      Constable supplied him with original letters by the Duke
                      of Lennox, who had accompanied James from Edinburgh to
                      London, and pointed Scott towards volumes of the king's
                      sayings and maxims housed in the Advocates' Library. By
                      early March 1822, he had almost completed the novel, despite
                      having to do the bulk of the work of the Clerk's table
                      due to Sir Robert Dundas's illness. As he was adding the
                      finishing touches, Scott's thoughts were already turning
                      towards an account of the reign of King Charles II and
                      the Popish Plot. By the time, <i>Nigel</i> was published
                      on May 29, 1822, <a href="peak.html"><i>Peveril of the
                      Peak</i></a> was well underway.</td>

            <p align="left">The plot concerns the efforts of Nigel Olifaunt,
              Lord Glenvarloch, to prevent the sale of his ancestral castle and
              estates. In order to do so, he travels to London to reclaim a large
              sum of money lent to King James I and VI by his father. As the
              royal favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, desires the land, the
              King is reluctant to comply with Nigel's request. Buckingham's
              friend, Lord Dalgarno, attempts to place Nigel in a disadvantageous
              light by luring him into a life of dissipation. Exaggerated reports
              of Nigel's follies reach the King, and he is isolated from the
              court. Apprised of Dalgarno's treachery, Nigel confronts and strikes
              him in the royal park of St. James, an offence punishable by the
              loss of his right hand. He solicits the King's favour but is sent
              to the Tower of London. His rescue is effected by a secret admirer,
              Margaret Ramsay, goddaughter of the King's banker, George Heriot.
              Margaret also wishes to restore the honour of her friend and patroness,
              Lady Hermione, whom Dalgarno has tricked into a false marriage.
              Disguised as a page she obtains an audience with King James, and
              persuades him of Nigel's innocence and Dalgarno's duplicity. Nigel's
              estates are redeemed, and he and Margaret wed. Dalgarno is compelled
              to make Hermione his lawful wife. Dalgarno makes off with his wife's
              money and heads for Scotland in an attempt to seize Nigel's land,
              but is ambushed and killed by robbers. The widowed Hermione makes
              Nigel and Margaret her heirs.</p>

            <p align="left">Critical reaction to <i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i> was
              decidedly mixed. The <i>Eclectic Review</i>, <i>Literary Gazette</i>,
              and <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> were warm in their praise, the latter
              judging it one of Scott's 'most brilliant and perfect creatures'.
              They expressed reservations, though, about the Lady Hermione subplot,
              felt to be a clumsy and non-essential distraction from the main
              strand of the tale. At the opposite extreme, the <i>Examiner</i> considered
              it a 'mere abortion' only partially redeemed by vivid descriptive
              passages, and the <i>New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal</i> detected
              'no principle of unity -- no central point of interest'. More evenhanded
              notices appeared in the <i>Scotsman</i>, which thought the novel
              'a brilliant, but unsatisfactory pageant', and in the <i>Quarterly</i>,
              which found the plot obscure and improbable and many of the characters
              dull, but praised the portrayal of King James.</p>
            <p align="left">Though the reviewers were divided, the phenomenal
              sales of Scott's novels continued unabated. Constable reported
              that on the day that the first batch of 7,000 copies reached London,
              all had been sold by 10.30. He had even seen people 'reading it
              in the Streets as they passed along' (letter to Scott, 31 May,
              1822).</p>
