              biography of <a href="../prose/napoleon.html">Napoleon Buonaparte</a>, 
              Scott began work on a new novel, with a view to completing it by 
              February 1826. The winter of 1825-26, however, saw the economic 
              recession which led to the ruin of his publishers and to Scott's 
              own insolvency (see<a href="../../biography/finance.html"> Financial 
              hardship</a>). Understandably, then, progress on <i>Woodstock</i> 
              was slower than anticipated. Scott had great difficulty deciding 
              how to finish the tale and was unimpressed with what he had written 
              as a whole. He finished the novel out of financial necessity rather 
              than artistic ambition and was relieved when Longmans paid &pound;6500 
              for an edition of 7900 copies. <i>Woodstock</i> was finally published 
              on April 28, 1826.</p>

			<p align="left">The novel is set in the year 1651 during the English 
                Civil War and revolves around Charles II's escape from the country
			  after the battle of Worcester. Sir Henry Lee, Ranger of the royal
                lodge and park of Woodstock, and a staunch supporter of the monarchy,
			  opposes the union of his daughter Alice and his nephew Colonel Markham
                Everard who has sided with the Parliamentarians and earned the
			  respect of Cromwell. Everard is able to prevent the sequestration of Woodstock
			  through his influence with Cromwell, who hopes, moreover, that the
                fugitive Charles II will choose it as a hiding place where he
			  could easily be captured. Charles does indeed take refuge there, disguised
			  as the page to Sir Henry's son, Albert. He proceeds to court the
                unwilling Alice to whom he reveals his true identity. The jealous
			  Everard quarrels with Charles, and bloodshed is avoided only by
                Alice's intervention. Everard is let into the secret of Charles's
			  disguise and promises not to betray him to Cromwell. Cromwell, though,
                is alerted to Charles's presence, lays siege to Woodstock, and
			  arrests Everard as a traitor. Charles, though, has been forewarned and effects
			  his escape, leaving Albert Lee to impersonate him. Pursuit is further
                delayed as Charles's followers distract the Parliamentarian forces
			  by 'playing at ghosts' in the secret passages of the supposedly
                haunted building. When Charles's escape becomes evident, Cromwell
			  orders that Everard and Sir Henry Lee be put to death, but relents
                and grants them a pardon. Charles's influence meanwhile has helped
			  assuage Sir Henry's prejudice against Everard, and he permits him
                to marry his daughter. Everard eventually comes to support the
			  Restoration, 
                in the hope that it will bring stable government.</p>

			<p align="left">Despite the concerns of Scott and Lockhart about potential 
              sales, the novel became an enormous success, and visitors flocked 
              to Woodstock. The critics were less effusive, censuring the 'supernatural'episodes 
              following Charles's escape from the building, and suggesting that 
              Scott was now writing solely for profit. The <i>Westminster Review</i> 
              was particularly hostile, accusing Scott of falsifying history to 
              propagate his political tenets. But Scott cared little for reviews 
              during his financial crisis. He was simply glad the novel was selling 
              well both north and south of the border, and that the general public 
              was enthusiastic. </p>
