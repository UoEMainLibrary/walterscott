            <p align="left"><em>Old Mortality</em> was conceived as the second
              volume of <em><a href="dwarf.html#tales">Tales of My Landlord</a></em>,
              which was originally to consist of four volumes each containing
              a separate regional tale. As the 'tale of the West' took hold of
              Scott's imagination, however, it expanded<i><em> </em></i>to fill
              three volumes, the standard length for a novel. </p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="63%">Having completed <em><a href="dwarf.html">The
                      Black Dwarf</a></em>, the first volume of the <em>Tales</em>,
                      somewhat behind schedule in August 1816, Scott began work
                      on <em>Old Mortality</em> in early September. It appears
                      that the novel originated in a suggestion from Scott's
                      antiquarian friend Joseph Train that he relate the anti-Covenanting
                      campaign of James Graham of Claverhouse as if from the
                      lips of 'Old Mortality', an old man that both had encountered
                      repairing the tombs of the Covenanters in Dunnottar Kirkyard.
                      'Old Mortality' indeed figures in the novel as the original
                      source of the landlord's story, thus adding one more layer
                      to the already dense framing narrative (see <em><a href="dwarf.html#tales">Tales
                      of My Landlord</a></em>). His memory jolted and imagination
                      fired, Scott completed the volume at great speed, penning
                      the last lines in early November 1816.</td>

            <p>For <i><a href="waverley.html">Waverley</a></i> Scott had relied
              heavily on living testimony from veterans and witnesses of the
              'Forty-five'. For <i>Old Mortality, </i>Scott relied on his own
              extensive knowledge of 17th-century historical sources, on contemporary
              pamphlets, and on oral traditions. Scott had a long-standing interest
              in the civil and ecclesiastical conflicts of the 17th century.
              He had included ballads describing the battles of the Covenanting
              period in the second volume of his <a href="../poetry/minstrelsy.html"><em>Minstrelsy
              of the Scottish Border</em></a>. His introduction and notes to
              those ballads provide a miniature history of the period and evidence
              that he was already a master of his sources.</p>
            <p>Scott's descriptions of Lanarkshire derive largely from a visit
              to Bothwell Castle, seat of Archibald Lord Douglas, in autumn 1799,
              which had included an excursion to the ruins of Craignethan Castle.
              Elements of both buildings are combined to construct the Castle
              of Tillietudlem in <em>Old Mortality</em>. Scott made further visits
              to Lanarkshire in 1801 (as a guest at Hamilton Palace) and in summer
              1816.</p>
            <p><em>Old Mortality</em> was published together with <em>The Black
                Dwarf</em> on December 2 1816. The printing process saw an unintended
                alteration to the title of the novel. Scott's manuscript indicates
                that it was originally to be called <em>The Tale of Old Mortality</em>,
                indicating that 'Old Mortality' was the source rather than the
                subject of the tale. Through a misunderstanding or oversight
                at <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">Ballantyne</a>'s printing
                office, the title was abbreviated. The full-length title was
                restored in Douglas Mack's recent Edinburgh Edition of the novel
                (Edinburgh University Press, 1993).</p>

            <p><em>Old Mortality</em> is set in 1679 against the backdrop of
              the military campaign waged by John Graham of Claverhouse's government
              forces against a Covenanting army. The Covenanters had risen against
              Charles II in protest against the reintroduction of Episcopalian
              church government. This had led to the destitution of around 270
              ministers, mainly in the West of Scotland, who had refused to
              take an oath of allegiance, to accept presentation to their charges
              by lay patrons, to submit themselves to bishops, and to recognize
              holy days. The expelled ministers retained the loyalty of many
              of their parishioners and continued to conduct worship in remote
              country spots. The attempt to break up these conventicles by military
              force and continued persecution of the Covenanters led to open
              revolt. </p>
            <p>The hero, Henry Morton of Milnwood, a moderate Presbyterian, is
              arrested by Claverhouse's troops for harbouring John Balfour of Burley, a Covenanting friend of his father. Unknown to Morton,
              Burley has participated in the murder of Archbishop Sharpe of St.
              Andrews (hated by the Covenanters for deserting their cause and
              aiding the restoration of Episcopalianism), the event which triggered
              the uprising. Morton is sentenced to death but is saved through
              the intervention of Lord Evandale, his friend and rival for the
              hand of Edith Bellenden. Incensed by the oppressive behaviour of
              the government forces, Morton makes common cause with the Covenanters
              and becomes one of their military leaders, exerting a moderating
              influence and striving to check the cruel fanaticism of many of
              his colleagues. He repays Evandale's favour by twice saving his
              life, thus preserving the affection of the Royalist Edith. When
              the Covenanters are finally defeated at Bothwell Bridge, Evandale
              again intercedes to limit Morton's sentence to exile. He enters
              the service of William of Orange, rises to the rank of major-general,
              and after the Revolution of 1688, returns to Scotland. He learns
              that Edith, believing him dead, is on the verge of marrying Evandale.
              Resolving not to interfere with their marriage, he remains incognito.
              He discovers, though, that Evandale's life is threatened by Frank
              Inglis, a fanatical persecutor of Covenanters punished by Evandale
              for mutiny. Morton rides to Evandale's rescue but is unable to
              prevent him being murdered in an ambush. With his dying words,
              Evandale blesses the union of Morton and Edith.</p>

            <p>So sure was the bookseller John Murray of the success of the <i>Tales</i>,
              that he ordered a second edition before the first went on sale.
              Within six weeks both editions were exhausted and a third in the
              press. Commercial success was matched by critical approval. Many
              reviewers echoed Scott's own judgment, that while <i>The Black
              Dwarf </i>re-trod familiar ground, <i>Old Mortality</i> was 'the
              best I have yet been able to execute' (letter to Lady Louisa Stuart,
              14 November 1816). In some quarters, though, Scott was accused
              of caricaturing the Covenanters and whitewashing the Royalists.
              In particular, the distinguished Presbyterian church historian
              Thomas M'Crie sought to vindicate the character of the Covenanters
              in his review in the <i>Edinburgh Christian Instructor</i>. His
              views were echoed in the <i>British Review</i> and <i>Eclectic
              Review </i>but refuted by Scott himself who anonymously reviewed
              his own novel in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. Here Scott proclaimed
              himself suspicious of 'that very susceptible devotion which so
              readily takes offense' and argued that 'such men should not read
              books of amusement'. On the whole, Scott's attempts to mystify
              public and reviewers as to the authorship of the new volume proved
              a failure, as it was widely perceived to have been written in the
              style of the 'Author of <i>Waverley</i>'. </p>
