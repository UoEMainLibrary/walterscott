            <p align="left"><img src="../../graphics/monastery1.jpg" alt="The White Lady and Father Philip, engraving by Charles Heath after Richard Westall, 1821 (P.2997)" width="211" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Scott first announced his plans for <em>The Monastery</em>              in
              a letter to his agent <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">John
              Ballantyne</a> on 2 August 1819, while he
              was still working on the second volume
            of <a href="ivanhoe.html"><em>Ivanhoe</em></a>. The publication process,
            he informed Ballantyne, would mark a departure from immediate precedent.
            From <em><a href="robroy.html">Rob Roy</a></em> onwards, he had chosen
            Archibald Constable to act as principal publisher with responsibility
            for managing and
            overseeing the publication process. One or more co-publishers had
            the right
            to advertise, sell, and distribute the novel in their own area. For
            <em>The Monastery</em>, Scott instructed Ballantyne to treat with
            the London firm of Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown. Constable
            would be relegated to the role of co-publisher (along with John
            Ballantyne himself). Scott's motives appear to have been exclusively
            financial. In a strained economical climate where Scottish banks
            had instigated a credit squeeze, Constable's credit was momentarily
            low. A London publisher would be better placed to secure Scott
            the advance that he urgently needed. On July 4, his son Walter had
            received
            an
            army
            commission,
            and Scott
            needed
                  ready
                  funds
                  to
                  cover his
                  initial
                  
            expenses. Also wishing to finance an extension of the <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>            estate,
            Scott had been counting on the imminent profits from <em>Ivanhoe</em>.
            By August, however, it was clear that a paper shortage at <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
            Ballantyne</a>'s
            printing office would seriously retard its publication. Scott clearly
            could not negotiate with Constable for the publication of a new novel
            while Constable was still overseeing the publication of <em>Ivanhoe</em>,
            a consideration which strengthened his resolve to turn to Longmans. </p>                        
            <p align="left">Constable accepted the share offered to him
              in the novel but felt deeply betrayed. He distrusted Longmans and
              regarded all aspects of the production of <em>The Monastery</em> as
              suspicious. He was fearful, above all, that sales of <em>The Monastery</em> would
              harm those of <em>Ivanhoe</em>. Scott, conversely, positively relished
              the prospect of entering into competition with himself. He initially
              planned to publish both novels almost simultaneously, without any
              indication of authorship. He was curious to see whether readers
              would guess that they were written by the same author. The more
              cautious Constable, however, finally prevailed upon him to credit
              both to the 'Author of <em>Waverley</em>'. The novel proper is,
              however, preceded by an Introductory Epistle by 'Captain Clutterbuck',
              a military veteran turned antiquarian. Clutterbuck relates how
              he has come into possession of a Benedictine document relating
              the history of the fictional Abbey of Kennaquhair and requests
              the 'Author of <em>Waverley</em>' to edit it for publication.</p>            
            <p align="left">Surviving evidence does not permit the composition
              of <em>The Monastery</em> to be charted with precision. The title
              was fixed by 13 August when it was used in a letter to John Ballantyne.
              It
              seems likely that Scott began work on <em>The Monastery</em> later
              in August, having momentarily laid aside <em>Ivanhoe</em> in frustration
              at the continuing paper shortage. He can only have worked on it
              for a matter of days,
              however, before returning to <em>Ivanhoe</em>, and the bulk of
              the manuscript must have been written after completion of the latter
              in November. Printing of <em>The
              Monastery</em>              began on or shortly before 29 November,
              and the final volume was at press by the end of February 1820.
              Although the novel's main
              publisher was London-based, <em>The Monastery</em> was first published
              in Edinburgh on 23 March and not until 30 March in London.</p>

            <p align="left"><em>The Monastery</em> cannot be traced back
              to any one original source or inspiration. It revisits geographical,
              historical, and literary material on which Scott had drawn for
              his <em><a href="../poetry/minstrelsy.html">Minstrelsy of the Scottish
              Border</a></em> and <a href="../poetry/minstrel.html"><em>The Lay
              of the Last Minstrel</em></a>,
              and enters into creative dialogue with those works. The story is
              set in the years preceding the Reformation in Scotland
              and in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Pinkie (1547),
              a catastrophic defeat for the Scots
              at
              the hands
              of Henry
              VIII's
              English army.
              The Border country portrayed in <em>The Monastery</em> is one devastated
              by Henry's 'Rough Wooing', the name given to his attempts to enforce
              marriage between the infant Mary Queen of Scots and his own heir,
              the future
              Edward VI. It is not, however, a simple
              matter of Anglo-Scottish rivalry. Scotland is divided between a
              Catholic faction which favours the 'auld alliance' with France
              and an emerging Protestant grouping which desires closer links
              with England. </p>
            <p align="left">Scott's principle historical sources are William
              Robertson's <em>The History of Scotland during the Reigns of Queen
              Mary and of King James VI</em> and John Knox's <em>Historie of
              the Reformation of the Church of Scotland</em>. For his portrayal of monastic life,
              he drew on Thomas Dudley Fosbrooke's <em>British Monachism</em>. Other sources
              include John Lyly's <em>Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit</em> for the courtier
              Sir Piercie Shafton and La Motte-Fouqu&eacute;'s <em>Undine</em> for the
              legendary White Lady. </p>

            <p align="left">The story revolves around the abbey of Kennaquhair,
                which Scott based on Melrose Abbey in the Scottish borders. As
                the
                Reformation takes hold, the monastic community comes increasingly
                under threat from the new doctrines. The hero, Halbert Glendinning
                is the son of a soldier who has died fighting for the monastery.
                He and his brother Edward are brought up within the grounds of
                Kennaquhair
                along with the orphan Mary Avenel, who has been cheated out of
                her inheritance by her uncle Julian, a ruthless Border baron.
              Both brothers
                are in love with Mary, but it is Halbert that wins her favour.
                An English knight Sir Piercie Shafton flees the court of Queen
                Elizabeth,
                having being implicated in a Catholic plot, and takes refuges
              in the monastery. He sets about wooing the indifferent Mary Avenel,
                which, along with his arrogant behaviour, angers Halbert. Further
                antagonism between the two is stirred by the White Lady, a supernatural
                guardian spirit of the destinies of the House of Avenel, who
              is
                opposed to the union of Mary and Halbert. A duel results, and
              believing he has killed his rival, Halbert flees. He subsequently
              converts
                to Protestantism and enters the service of the Earl of Murray,
              half-brother to Mary Queen of Scots. Shafton,
                though, is miraculously cured by the White Lady, but his continuing
                presence at Kennaquhair creates trouble with the English court.
                He finally surrenders to Murray; his claims to high birth are
              exposed as false, and he is sent into exile. Halbert has risen
              so rapidly
                in Murray's favour that he sanctions his marriage with Mary
                Avenel (whom the White Lady has caused to be converted to Protestantism).
                The disappointed Edward Glendinning takes monastic orders and
              will reappear as the title character in Scott's next novel<i> <a href="abbot.html">The
                 Abbot</a></i>.</p>

            <p align="left">Sales of <em>The Monastery</em> were moderate, though
                it fared better in Edinburgh than in London. The novel disappointed
                
              many, including Scott himself who wrote: 'I agree with the
              public in thinking the work not very interesting; but it was written
              with as much care as the others that is with no care at all' (letter
                to<a href="../../biography/ballant.html"> James Ballantyne</a>,
                 28 March, 1820). Although there were some highly favourable
                reviews,
              notably in <i>Blackwood</i>'<i>s </i>and the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
                 critics were almost unanimous in condemning the use of supernatural
                
              machinery. The <i>Edinburgh Monthly Review</i>, in an otherwise
                 positive notice, considered the White Lady 'absurd almost to
              childishness',
              while the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> found her 'insufferable'. Neither
                 did Sir Piercie Shafton find great favour with reviewers and
              the
              general reader, seeming to many a gross comic caricature. Such,
                 however, was Scott's selling power after <i>Ivanhoe</i> that
            commercial success was assured.</p>
