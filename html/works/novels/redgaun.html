                <td width="62%">There is little surviving evidence regarding the genesis
                  of <em>Redgauntlet</em>. Scott's only recorded remarks on the
                  novel to follow <a href="well.html"><em>Saint Ronan's Well</em></a> are
                  misleading. On September 9 1823, with <i>Saint Ronan's Well </i>only
                  half-written, Scott's publisher Archibald Constable reports
                  to his partner Robert Cadell that Scott had already sketched
                  out the plan of its successor, a supernaturally themed work
                  entitled <i>The Witch</i>. This description in no way matches <i><em>Redgauntlet</em></i>,
                  or indeed any of the subsequent Waverley Novels, although some
                  of the material may have been channelled into <i><em><a href="../prose/witchcraft.html">Letters
                  on Demonology and Witchcraft</a></em></i> (1830). Later, on
                  13 January 1824, Scott informs Cadell that he is working on
                  a novel set during the Crusades. He subsequently mentions the
                  same idea in correspondence with his friends Daniel Terry (5
                  February) and Lady Louisa Stuart (4 April), both of whom had
                  been apprized of Scott's identity as the 'Author of <em>Waverley</em>'.
                  Clearly, however, he is referring to <a href="betrothed.html"><em>The
                  Betrothed</em></a> and <a href="talisman.html"><em>The Talisman</em></a>,
                  published together immediately after <em>Redgauntlet</em> as <em>Tales
                of the Crusaders</em>. </td>

            <p>Scott's silence as to the novel he was actually composing -- a
              silence which verges on deliberate misdirection -- lends support
              to the widely held view that <em>Redgauntlet </em>is Scott's most
              deeply personal novel. It offers more parallels with Scott's own
              life
              story than any other Waverley Novel. In particular, it draws on
              Scott's training as a lawyer and preparation for the bar (see <a href="../../biography/law.html">Professional
              Life</a>), on the tour of the Lake District in 1797 when he met
              his wife (see <a href="../../biography/marriage.html">Williamina,
              Charlotte and Marriage</a>), and on a professional visit to Dumfries
              and Galloway in 1807. Many commentators have detected a self-portrait
              in the young lawyer Alan Fairford, and a depiction of Scott's own
              father in the sternly Presbyterian Saunders Fairford. Models for
              Alan's friend Darsie Latimer have been sought in Scott's fellow
              students William Clerk and Charles Kerr of Abbotrule.</p>
            <p>Whatever the truth of the novel's genesis, it was composed with
              Scott's customary speed. Cadell received proofs of the first sixty-four
              pages on 8 January 1824, so it is likely that Scott began work
              on the novel at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> during
              his Christmas vacation of 1823-24. The first volume was complete
              by 21 March, the third in process by the beginning of May, and
              the final pages delivered on 2 June. By 14 June 1824, it was on
              sale. Scott, though, was slow to settle upon the published title.
              According to J.G. Lockhart in his <em>Memoirs of the Life of Sir
              Walter Scott, Bart</em>. (1837-38), Archibald Constable and <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
              Ballantyne</a> faced an arduous task in persuading Scott to adopt<em> Redgauntlet</em> in
              place of the working title of <em>Herries</em> or <em>Herris</em>.
              However, G.A.M. Wood and David Hewitt, editors of the recent Edinburgh
              edition of <em>Redgauntlet</em> (1997), detect no such struggle.
              They confirm that the published title was suggested by Ballantyne
              in late April, but note that Scott immediately adopted it with
              enthusiasm. His only reservation (justified as it turned out) was
              that it might lead readers to expect a tale of chivalry. As Ballantyne
              had been in London for most of March and April, and Constable was
              seriously ill, there can have been no preceding campaign to persuade
              Scott to abandon <em>Herries</em>. For Wood and Hewitt, the working-title
              was just that; there is no evidence that Scott was particularly
              committed to it.</p>

            <p>Internal evidence dates the action of the novel to July and August
              1765. Following <em><a href="waverley.html">Waverley</a></em>, <a href="dwarf.html"><em>The
              Black Dwarf</em></a>, <em><a href="mortality.html">Old Mortality</a></em>,
              and <em><a href="robroy.html">Rob Roy</a></em>, Scott once again
              portrays a Jacobite uprising. This time, however, the rebellion
              is entirely fictional. By 1765, the Jacobite cause is, in Scott's
              estimate, defeated and its fictional champion, Redgauntlet, swimming
              against the tide of history. Prominent Jacobites have made their
              peace with the Hanoverian regime, and Scots are increasingly embracing
              the economic and military opportunities presented by Britain's
              emerging Empire. Victory in the Seven Years' War, concluded in
              1763, has seen the eclipse of France's imperial ambitions and the
              emergence of Britain as the dominant colonial power on the global
              stage. </p>
            <p align="left">A major source was William King's <em>Political and
                Literary Anecdotes of His Own Times</em>. King, former leader
                of the Jacobites at Oxford University, recounts Prince Charles's
                clandestine visit to London in 1750 and vain attempts to persuade
                him to abandon his mistress, episodes echoed in Scott's novel.
                Scott would also have been aware of rumours that Prince Charles
                made further visits in 1761 and 1763 and that on the last occasion
                George III ordered that no action be taken for fear of turning
                Charles into a martyr. Similar motives lie behind the Hanoverian
                authorities' decision in <em>Redgauntlet</em> to let the Jacobite
                conspirators return quietly to the Continent.</p>

            <p align="left">The plot revolves around the (purely fictional) return
              of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to England some years after 1745
              in a final attempt to claim the crown. The Jacobite party is energetically
              led by a Border laird, Redgauntlet, otherwise known as Herries
              of Birrenswork. He kidnaps his young nephew Darsie Latimer (whose
              real name is Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet), hoping that his prestige
              as the head of the house will aid the Jacobite cause. Darsie, whose
              father was executed for his role in the 1745 rebellion, has been
              brought up in Edinburgh under an assumed name and in ignorance
              of his true identity. When informed by Redgauntlet of his family
              history, he resists all attempts to involve him in the rebellion.
              Meanwhile Darsie's school-friend the lawyer Alan Fairford (in whom
              many critics have seen an authorial self-portrait) sets out to
              rescue him, aided along the way by the Quaker Joshua Geddes, the
              sea-captain Nanty Ewart, and the blind fiddler Wandering Willie.
              Both Darsie and Fairford fall in love with the mysterious 'Greenmantle',
              who lives with Herries as his ward. Redgauntlet fails to whip up
              sufficient support for the rebellion and the plot is discovered
              by the government. The Young Pretender is permitted to return to
              France and his supporters are not pursued. Seeing that his party
              is no longer regarded as a serious threat, Redgauntlet realizes
              that the Jacobite cause is finished and accompanies Charles into
              exile. Darsie is liberated and remains a staunch Hanoverian. Fairford
              marries 'Greenmantle' who is revealed to be Lilias, Darsie's sister,
              kidnapped by Redgauntlet in early childhood</p>

            <p align="left">Although now regarded as amongst the finest of the
              Waverley novels, <i>Redgauntlet</i> met with a lukewarm critical
              and public reaction at its first appearance. There were broadly
              favourable reviews in the <i>Scotsman</i> and <i>Literary Gazette</i>,
              both of which particularly praised the embedded Scots narrative
              generally known as 'Wandering Willie's Tale'. Based on a suggestion
              by Scott's friend, the exciseman and amateur antiquarian Joseph
              Train, 'Wandering Willie's Tale' binds together numerous traditional
              motifs and is widely viewed as one of the world's greatest short
              stories. Other journals, such as the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> and <i>Monthly
              Review</i>, objected to the mixture of epistolary and narrative
              sequences and felt that, in all events, the epistolary form was
              a throwback to the conventions of the eighteenth-century novel.
              Much harsher were the <i>Examiner</i> and <i>London Magazine</i>,
              declaring that Scott was now working merely for profit and that
              it was pointless to subject such productions to critical appraisal.
              Critical censure was matched by slow sales. Scott, who was firmly
              persuaded of <i>Redgauntlet</i>'s critical merit, remarked to Ballantyne
              that 'the world wants novelty more than superior excellence' (<em>Letters</em>,
              VIII, 325).</p>
