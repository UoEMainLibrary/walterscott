                      of <a href="waverley.html"><em>Waverley</em></a>, Scott
                      was still in a hazardous financial situation, having narrowly
                      avoided bankruptcy when John Ballantyne's publishing house
                      had collapsed in 1813 (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html">Financial
                      Hardship</a>). In mid-October 1814 a distraint for debt
                      was served on John's brother James, which threatened to
                      expose Scott's position as secret partner in James's printing
                      firm (see <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">Ballantyne
                      Brothers</a>). Frustration with James's imprudence may
                      have proven the immediate spur to secure a contract with
                      Longmans of London for a sequel to <em>Waverley</em>. </p>

            <p><em>Guy Mannering</em> was advertised as in the press on 21 December
              1814, only two days after Scott had finished writing the notes
              to <em>The Lord of the Isles</em>. Scott appears to have written <em>Guy
              Mannering</em> in little more than six weeks, beginning late December
              1814 and completing it by mid-February 1815. So rapid was its composition
              that novel and poem were effectively published and promoted in
              tandem, providing Scott with a unique opportunity to compare the
              selling power of verse and fiction. The latter proved conspicuously
              more lucrative. When <em>Guy Mannering</em> was published on February
              24, 1815, the Edinburgh share of the first edition sold out in
              less than a day. Two further editions were published in March and
              May, and the novel went through eleven editions in Scott's life-time.
              The title page attributed the novel to 'the author of <i>Waverley</i>',
              a phrase that would be used for all Scott's novels until he cast
              off his disguise in 1827. </p>

            <p align="left"><em>Guy Mannering</em> is located chiefly in Galloway,
              in the south-west of Scotland, in the late eighteenth century.
              Traditionally, Scott's chief source for the story been has identified
              as Joseph Train, a Galloway exciseman and amateur antiquarian,
              who initiated a correspondence with Scott in July 1814. According
              to Scott's first biographer, his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart, he
              had encouraged Train to supply him with Galloway traditions. Train
              had subsequently sent a collection of anecdotes on Galloway gypsies
              and the local story of an astrologer who, predicting the future
              of a newborn child, accurately warned of great dangers that would
              befall him on his twenty-first birthday. Both, in Lockhart's account
              (based on Train's own published recollections), worked their way
              into the novel. Peter D. Garside, however, editor of the recent
              Edinburgh Edition of <em>Guy Mannering</em> (1999), finds little
              evidence that Train supplied such information before the preparation
              of the Magnum Opus edition of the novel in 1829. Garside argues
              that a more plausible source was Scott's sister-in-law Elizabeth
              McCulloch Scott, a noted repository of Galloway lore. There are
              close parallels between the history of the Bertram family, as described
              in chapter 2 of <em>Guy Mannering</em>, and that of Elizabeth's
              family, the McCullochs of Ardwall, who long tolerated on their
              lands the gypsy 'king' Billy Marshall.</p>

            <p align="left">The hero, Harry Bertram, son of the Laird of Ellangowan,
              is kidnapped as a boy by the smuggler Dirk Hatteraick and carried
              off to Holland. Hatteraick is acting in league with the Bertrams'
              lawyer, Gilbert Glossin, who hopes to acquire the family property
              in the absence of a male heir. Adopted by a Dutch merchant, Bertram
              is kept in ignorance of his true identity and brought up under
              the name Vanbeest Brown. Upon reaching adulthood, he travels to
              India and enlists in the army under Colonel Guy Mannering. Mannering,
              an enthusiastic amateur astrologer, has in a previous guise visited
              the Bertrams' castle of Ellangowan, and predicted the newborn Harry's
              future. Bertram falls in love with Mannering's daughter, Julia,
              but Mannering imagines that the attentions paid to his daughter
              are intended for his wife. He challenges Bertram to a duel, seriously
              wounds him, and leaves him for dead. On recovery, Bertram finds
              that Julia has returned to Britain. In disguise, he follows her
              to the neighbourhood of Ellangowan. Glossin, now sole owner of
              Ellangowan, detects his true identity, and again plots with Hatteraick
              to abduct him. However, Meg Merrilies, Bertram's gypsy nurse, recognizes
              him too, and with the help of Bertram and Dandie Dinmont (a Lowland
              farmer whom Bertram has rescued from footpads), attempts to thwart
              their scheme. This she succeeds in doing but at the expense of
              her own life. As a result of her efforts, Bertram is acknowledged,
              regains his estates, and marries Julia. </p>

            <p align="left"><i>Guy Mannering </i>was an immediate success with
              the reading public, the Edinburgh share of the first edition selling
              out within a day. Within three months the second and third impressions
              were similarly exhausted. The reviewers, though, harboured reservations.
              The <i>British Critic</i> felt that the genius shown in <i>Waverley</i> had
              already flickered out. The <i>Critical Review</i> and the <i>Quarterly</i> feared
              that the extensive use of Scots would prove incomprehensible to
              an English audience. The former complained too that it encouraged
              superstition, condoned duelling, and was irreverent in matters
              of religion. There was widespread praise, however, of the vividly
              portrayed minor characters, Dandie Dinmont and Meg Merrilies, the
              latter bringing comparisons with Shakespeare.</p>
