                of the Canongate</i></a>.
                Scott's original plan, however, had been to compile a miscellany
              of shorter fiction in the manner of the First Series of <em>Chronicles</em>.
              The contract for the Second Series was signed on 29 November 1827
              and by 3 December he had completed an introductory narrative by
              'Chrystal Croftangry' and two short tales 'My Aunt Margaret's
              Mirror' and 'The
                  Death
                  of
                  the
                  Laird's
            Jock'. Scott was momentarily uncertain how to proceed, declaring
              in his <em>Journal </em>for 4 December that he felt 'a little puzzled
              about the character and style of the next tale'. The world, he
              feared,
              was sated with tales of chivalry, although <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
            Ballantyne</a>              was once again urging him in that direction.
            By the next day, he believed he had hit upon a means of refreshing
            potentially stale subject-matter. His new tale, provisionally titled
            'The North Inch of Perth' would deal with a ceremonial battle in
            1396 in which the champions of two Highland Clans fought to settle
            a grievance in the presence of King Robert III and his court. What
            particularly caught Scott's imagination was the tradition that one
            of the champions had fled the field either before or during the combat.
            'Suppose', Scott wrote in his <em>Journal</em> for 5 December 'a
            man's nerves supported by feelings of honour, or say by the spur
            of jealousy
            supporting him against constitutional timidity to a certain point,
            then suddenly giving way,&#8212;I think something tragic might be
            produced.' The theme of the 'brave coward or cowardly brave man'
            would be embodied in the finished narrative by Conachar, chief
            of Clan Quhele.            </p>
            <p align="left">Scott began work on 7 December and was making steady
              progress when on 11 December he was shaken by a letter from his
              publisher Robert Cadell. Cadell, backed by James Ballantyne, pointed
              to the moderate success of the First Series of <em>Chronicles</em> and expressed
              dissatisfaction with the two tales and introductory narrative so
              far submitted for the Second Series. Scott initially responded
              with an acknowledgement that inspiration was wearing thin and a
              suggestion that he take a break from writing. His <em>Journal </em>for
              12 December
              acknowledges,
              however,
              that his financial circumstances would permit no rest. In
              particular, he and Cadell had been hoping to use the anticipated
              profits of
              the Second Series of <em>Chronicles</em> to bid for a half-share
              in the copyright of the earlier Waverley Novels which was being
              auctioned
              by Archibald Constable's creditors on 20 December. Their ultimately
              successful bid would pave the way for the publication of the lucrative
              'Magnum Opus' edition of Scott's fiction (1829-33). On further
              reflection, then, he suggested to Ballantyne and Cadell that he
              abandon 'the losing game of novel writing' for another field of
              literature. The two men, both financially dependent on Scott's
               success as a novelist, were horrified. A compromise was hammered
              out. Scott would continue work on the <em>Chronicles</em> but would
              omit 'My Aunt Margaret's Mirror' and 'The Death of the Laird's
              Joke',
              radically reduce the Croftangry narrative, and concentrate on the
              'Perth' tale, the opening pages of which Cadell and Ballantyne
              had now seen and approved. Originally conceived as a short-story,
              this was now recast as a
              three-volume
              novel. (Scott would subsequently publish the rejected tales in
              Frederic Reynold's annual Christmas gift-book <em>The Keepsake</em>.
              Together with 'The Tapestried Chamber', they are generally known
              as the <em>Keepsake Stories</em>.)</p>
            <p align="left">By 15 December Scott was back at work on what was
              now known as 'Saint Valentine's Eve'. After an extended Christmas
              break, the first volume was complete by 5 February 1828. In his
              <em>Journal</em> Scott declared himself 'but indifferently pleased',
              fearing that 'either
              the kind of thing is worn out or I am worn out myself'. Ballantyne
              too was unenthusiastic, objecting to the murder of Oliver Proudfute
              and regretting the tragic bent of the tale. The remaining volumes
              were written at extraordinary speed, even by Scott's exceptional
                standards. The second volume was complete on 2 March, Scott again
              proclaiming himself 'not much pleased with it' and lamenting its
              lack of 'passion'. The third and final volume was complete by 29
              March, although Scott was not satisfied that he had convincingly
              bound together the novel's three narrative threads: the clan fight
              and cowardice of Conachar, the love affair between Henry Smith
              and Catherine Glover, and the involvement of the Duke of Rothsay
              and other historical characters. He was, though, proud of his industry:
            'I have let no grass grow beneath my heels this bout.'</p>

            <p>Scott had long been familiar with the historical and legendary
              core material from which the novel grew.
              As far back as <a href="robroy.html"><em>Rob Roy</em></a> (1818),
              there is a reference to the artisan Henry Smith or Gow who, according
              to legend, made up the numbers for one of the clans in the 1396
            battle when it found itself a man short. Scott drew extensively on
              medieval and Renaissance sources: John Barbour's <em>The Bruce</em>,
              Blind Hary's <em>The Wallace</em>, Andrew of Wyntoun's <em>Original
              Chronicle of Scotland</em>, John of Fordun's <em>Chronica gentis
              scotorum</em>, Walter
              Bower's <em>Scotichronicon</em>, and Boece's <em>Scotorum historiae</em>.
              Two later sources proved particularly fruitful: Henry Adamson's
              <em>The Muses Threnodie</em> (1638) for its poetical history of
              Perth and John Pinkerton's <em>History of Scotland under the House
              of Stuart</em>              (1797) for its portrayal of Robert
              III, Albany, Rothsay, and Ramorny.</p>
            <p>Scott's sources permitted him ample liberty of invention. Details
              of the battle are scarce, and there is not even general agreement
              on which clans were involved. In the Introduction, Scott's narrator
              Chrystal Croftangry explains that he prefers to avoid 'the well
              known paths of history, where every one can read the finger<br>
              posts carefully set up to advise them of the right turning; and
              the very boys and girls, who learn the history of Britain by way
              of question and answer, hoot at a poor author if he abandons the
              highway'. Scott abandons the highway so far as to telescope ten
              years of history into six weeks, bringing forward the murder of
              Rothsay by six years and the death of Robert III by ten.</p>

            <h3><font color="#003366"><a name="synopsis" id="synopsis"></a>Synopsis</font></h3>
            <p>The novel is set in the late fourteenth century during the reign
              of Robert III of Scotland. The King's son, the Duke of Rothsay,
              attempts to abduct Catharine Glover, the 'Fair Maid of Perth',
              daughter of an honest burgher. He is thwarted by the intervention
              of Henry Smith or Gow, an armourer and renowned swordsman, who
              hacks off the hand of Sir John Ramorny, the Duke's Master of Horse.
              Although backed by Catharine's father Simon, Henry appears too
              warlike to win the hand of the mild-mannered 'Maid'. Ramorny tries
              and fails to avenge himself on Henry, then vents his anger on Rothsay,
              who has dismissed him at his father's behest. Rothsay is lured
              to the castle of Falkland and murdered; the crime is discovered
              and Ramorny promptly executed. Meanwhile, a bitter rivalry develops
              between Henry and Conachar, his Highland apprentice, as both contend
              for Catharine's affections. Conachar becomes chief of Clan Quhele
              after the death of his father, and the King demands that the longstanding
              feud between Clan Quhele and Clan Chattan be resolved by mortal
              combat between thirty members of each clan. At the last moment
              one of the representatives of Clan Chattan withdraws and is replaced
              by Henry who relishes the opportunity of confronting Conachar.
              At the end of a bloody battle, the two come face to face. Betrayed
              by his constitutional cowardice, Conachar flees and, overcome with
              shame, commits suicide. Henry, weary of battle and bloodshed, vows
              that henceforth he will only fight in Scotland's service, and is
              finally accepted by Catharine.</p>

            <p><i>The Fair Maid of Perth</i> was an immense and immediate success,
              winning applause from no less a figure than <a href="../poetry/apology/poets.html#goethe">Goethe</a>.
              Criticism was almost unanimously favourable, with the <i>Athenaeum</i> declaring
              that it 'may fairly be ranked as equal with the best and most admired
              productions of the author'. Scott was modest about the success
              of the novel but in his <em>Journal</em> he wrote proudly: 'I can spin a
              tough yarn still' (5 June 1828). Together with<i> <a href="redgaun.html">Redgauntlet</a>,
              The Fair Maid of Perth</i> represents one of the peaks of Scott's
              late career.</p>
