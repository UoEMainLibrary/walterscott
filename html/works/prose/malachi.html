                <td width="51%">In 1826, after a series of bank failures in England,
                  the British government proposed a drastic reform of the banking
                  system. It was decided to forbid private banks from issuing
                  banknotes smaller than &pound;5, as many struggling English
                  banks had proved unable to redeem them. Like many of his countrymen,
                  Scott feared this measure would be disastrous for Scotland
                  where the scarcity of gold and silver made small notes the
                  principal medium of circulation. It would strike at the prosperity
                  of Scotland's banks which depended on their ability to create
                  credit. The inevitable result would be a drop in prices accompanied
                  by economic depression. </td>

            <p>Scott launched a caustic attack on the Government proposal in
              three letters, published in the <i>Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i> (February
              22, March 1, and March 8, 1826) and subsequently in pamphlet-form.
              He adopted the transparent persona of Malachi Malagrowther, purportedly
              a descendent of Sir Mungo Malagrowther, the malcontented courtier
              in <a href="../novels/nigel.html"><i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i></a>.
              He was also following a literary precedent, Jonathan Swift's <i>Drapier's
              Letters</i>, in which, posing as a linen-draper, the author had
              appealed to Irish national sentiment in a successful campaign to
              prevent the coinage of copper currency for circulation in Ireland.</p>
            <p><font size="2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></font></p>
            <h3><font color="#003366"><a name="synopsis" id="synopsis"></a>Synopsis</font></h3>
            <p>The first letter noted that Scotland had known few bank failures
              in the previous fifty years and that the economy had flourished
              under the existing system. Industry and agriculture had progressed
              rapidly. Paper currency, so distrusted in England, had made banking
              services available to remote communities and facilitated the transmission
              of capital in a sparsely populated country. No Scottish bank had
              failed during the current crisis, so it would be unjust to punish
              Scottish banks for the misdeeds of their English neighbours. The
              Government had been misled by a love of uniformity for uniformity's
              sake and was encroaching upon Scottish prerogatives. As the measures
              would greatly impair Scotland's sources of credit, they clearly
              violated the Treaty of Union of 1707, which stipulated that no
              changes should be made to the law of Scotland unless to her own
              evident benefit.</p>
            <p>The second letter called upon all Scottish representatives in
              the two Houses of Parliament to declare a legislative strike. Scott
              urged them to vote on no measures except when they opposed the
              Government. He hoped that Irish MPs would join their Scottish colleagues,
              as the Government scheme would create a precedent from which Ireland
              might in turn suffer.</p>
            <p>The first two letters, which were republished as pamphlets by
              Blackwood (on the March 1 and 4, 1826) had an immense impact, galvanizing
              Scottish national opinion. Public meetings were held throughout
              the country in opposition to the Government scheme. As a series
              of bitter attacks from the Government benches made it clear that
              ministers were genuinely rattled, an exultant Scott penned a third
              letter, published as a pamphlet on March 13. This highlighted the
              distress that would inevitably be caused during the transition
              from bank notes to coinage. Gold and silver would need to be purchased
              at a premium, and industries that operated at a small margin of
              profit would suffer. A working system and prosperous economy would
              be jeopardized merely to test a theory.</p>

            <h3><font color="#003366"><a name="reception" id="reception"></a>Reception</font></h3>
            <p>The letters amply achieved their aim. The Government first promised
              that the new regulations would not be applied in Scotland for six
              months, then for six years, and by mid-May 1826 abandoned the scheme
              altogether. To this day, Walter Scott's portrait appears on Bank
              of Scotland banknotes in recognition of his defence of the Scottish
              banking system.</p>
