                <td width="57%">In May 1825, Archibald Constable revealed to
                  Scott his ambition to bring literature within the financial
                  reach of the middle classes and of the increasingly literate
                  working classes by publishing a series of inexpensive editions.
                  Scott gave the scheme an enthusiastic welcome and agreed to
                  inaugurate the new series, known as <i>Constable's Miscellany</i>,
                  with a reissue of the first part of <a href="../novels/waverley.html"><i>Waverley</i></a> and
                  with the first volume of an entirely new work, a study of the
                  life and times of the French Emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte. Scott
                  announced his forthcoming work in his introduction to <i>Tales
                  of the Crusaders</i> published in June (see <a href="../novels/talisman.html"><i>The
                  Talisman</i></a> and <i><a href="../novels/betrothed.html">The
                  Betrothed</a></i>), creating feverish anticipation throughout
                  the literary world and bringing immediate requests for foreign
                  rights.</td>

            <p align="left">The biography was originally to run to four volumes,
              but the immense amount of reading that Scott undertook soon led
              it to stretch far beyond Constable's original conception for the <i>Miscellany</i>.
              In 1826, though, Constable's business collapsed, and Scott, whose
              affairs were intrinsically linked with those of his publishers
              and printers, was left with debts of &pound;121,000 (see <a href="../../biography/finance.html">Financial
              hardship</a>). In May of the same year, his wife <a href="../../biography/marriage.html">Charlotte</a> died.
              Under these immensely trying conditions, which took a heavy toll
              on Scott's health, he produced a formidable body of work, working
              at extraordinary speed. During the inevitable intervals in the
              composition of 'Bony', as he waited for source material to arrive,
              Scott find time to write <i><a href="../novels/cavalier.html">Woodstock</a></i> and
              to begin work on the <i><a href="../novels/canongate.html">Chronicles
              of the Canongate</a></i>.</p>
            <p align="left">To supplement information gleaned from reading and
              from correspondence with military and political figures, Scott
              made a research trip to London in October 1826, where the government
              had granted him free access to archives dealing with Napoleon's
              exile in St. Helena. Later in the same month he visited Paris to
              speak with former colleagues of Napoleon, and was lionized by the
              social and literary world. Among Scott's influential network of
              correspondents in both the British and French governments was the
              Duke of Wellington himself who provided a first-hand account of
              Napoleon's Russian Campaign.</p>

            <p align="left">After his return to Scotland, the biography continued
              to expand to incorporate the mass of detail that Scott had accumulated.
              By the time it was complete on June 7, 1827, it had stretched to
              fully nine volumes, containing over a million words. Yet this massive
              undertaking was, in Lockhart's words, 'the work of one twelvemonth--done
              in the midst of pain, sorrow, and ruin'. The first volume was finally
              published in June 1827, jointly by Cadell in Edinburgh and Longman's
              in London (who in October 1826 had successfully offered 10,500
              guineas for the work).</p>

              presents a dispassionate, unpartisan view of Napoleon, paying tribute
              to his military genius and administrative skill and underlining
              his legacy to France in the form of a national system of education,
              greatly improved communications, and the Code Napol&eacute;on.
              Refusing to paint him as the bloodthirsty despot presented by many
              a fellow Tory, Scott notes his mild and humane temperament and
              genuine love of his country. The seeds of his downfall lie in his
              progressive self-identification with the French people and in his
              vision of himself as the man on whom the nation's destiny rested.
              His life ultimately becomes a tale of hubris, where overweaning
              ambition and self-blinding egotism lead to defeat in the Russian
              snows.</p>

            <p align="left">Napoleon was an immediate, worldwide commercial success.
              Critical response, however, was lukewarm. There was censure of
              Scott's 'poetic' approach and over-literary language. The <i>Eclectic
              Review</i> judged Scott's knowledge 'extremely superficial', and
              the <i>London Weekly Review</i> opined that it would be read with
              'pleasure' and 'emotion' but not 'confidence'. For the <i>Monthly
              Review</i>, it was simply 'A signal and palpable failure'. Despite
              Scott's fears that his studied impartiality would provoke both
              admirers and despisers of Napoleon, few reviewers took serious
              issue with his political thesis. An exception was the young John
              Stuart Mill in the radical <i>Westminster Review</i> who expressed
              serious reservations about the opening volume, a preliminary sketch
              of the French Revolution before the appearance of Napoleon. For
              Mill, Scott was over-indulgent towards Louis XVI, too dismissive
              of the Republicans'' attempts to negotiate with the King, and unfair
              in seeing the roots of the Revolution in the works of the Enlightenment <i>philosophes</i>.</p>
            <p align="left">Scott reacted to all criticism with his customary
              equanimity. 'I could have done it better', Lockhart quotes him
              as saying, 'if I could have written at more leisure, and with a
              mind more at ease'.</p>
