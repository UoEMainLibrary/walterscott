                  <p>While putting the finishing touches to his <a href="napoleon.html"><i>Life
                      of Napoleon</i></a> in May 1827, Scott had the idea of
                      writing a History of Scotland addressed to his six-year-old
                      grandchild John Hugh Lockhart whom he called by the nickname
                      of Hugh Littlejohn (see, right, <a href="../../portraits/engravers/horsburgh.html">John
                      Horsburgh</a>'s engraving of Sir William Allan's portrait).
                      The project was partly inspired by the success of John
                      Wilson Croker's <i>Stories Selected from the History as
                      England </i>(1822), but Scott felt that Croker underestimated
                      the intelligence of his juvenile audience. Children, Scott
                      believed, disliked books 'written down' to their level,
                      preferring a challenge to their understanding and curiosity.
                      He hoped to cater, moreover, for both a juvenile and a
                      popular audience and thus to find a way 'between what a
                      child can comprehend and what shall not yet be absolutely
                uninteresting to the grown reader' (<em>Journal</em>, July 8, 1827). </p></td>

            </table>            <p align="left">Initially, this
                  middle 
                  ground proved elusive, and Scott came to feel that he was guilty
                   of 'writing down' at the beginning of the first volume. <a href="../../biography/ballant.html">James
                    Ballantyne</a> concurred, judging the tone of the opening
                    chapters alternately too historical and too infantile. So
                    familiar
                    was Scottish
                  history to Scott, however, that once he had found a satisfactory
                     register, he worked rapidly upon the manuscript. The First
                    Series,
                which covered the period between the reign of Macbeth (1033-56)
                     and the Union of the Crowns (1603), was complete by November
                    1827. 
                  It was published on December 15, 1827 with an eye to the Christmas
                     market. It sold so well that before the end of the month,
                    Cadell
                had commissioned a revised and enlarged second edition. </p>

II, of Tales of a Grandfather, drawn by Stewart Watson, engraved by W.H. Lizars, 1830 (Corson A.14.TGF.a.1830/5)" width="230" height="165" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="middle"></p>            <p align="left">In May 1828 Scott agreed to write a Second Series 
              of <i>Tales</i>. By July, he realized he had so much material that 
              he proposed ending the series with the Union of England and Scotland 
              (1707) then composing a Third Series extending the narrative to 
              the end of the eighteenth century. The Second Series was completed 
              on September 1, 1828 and published on November 27. The Third Series, 
              which culminated in the aftermath of Culloden (1746), appeared on 
            December 21, 1829.</p>
            <p align="left">In July 1830, agreed to write a fourth series dealing 
              with French history from Charlemagne to Louis XIV. His research 
              for these volumes also fed into his novel <a href="../novels/robert.html"><i>Count 
              Robert of Paris</i></a> (1832) and revisited material used in his 
              earlier <i><a href="../novels/durward.html">Quentin Durward</a></i> 
              and <i><a href="../novels/geierstein.html">Anne of Geierstein</a></i>. 
              Published on December 20, 1830, the Fourth Series was received as 
              favourably as the earlier <i>Tales</i>, and a second French series 
              was pledged for Christmas 1831. Scott completed the first volume 
              but suspended the second midway, in order to concentrate on <i>Count 
              Robert of Paris</i> and <a href="../novels/dangerous.html"><i>Castle 
              Dangerous</i></a>. On December 15, 1831 Scott received news of the 
              death of the ten-year-old John Hugh Lockhart. He was not to return 
              to the manuscript before his death.</p>

            <p align="left">The tremendous popular success of the <i>Tales</i> 
              was matched by almost unanimous critical approval. The <i>Athenaeum</i>, 
              in particular, welcomed them as an important contribution to the 
              campaign to encourage improving writing for children. Scott was 
              widely applauded for his efforts to be even-handed towards different 
              political factions. Some critics, however, such as Andrew Bisset 
              in the <i>Westminster Review</i>, censured Scott for not drawing 
              sufficiently clear moral lessons from the events recounted. The 
              <i>Edinburgh Literary Journal</i> too felt that Scott was inclined 
              to sit on the fence and to avoid potentially controversial topics 
            in a quest for popularity.</p>
            <p>The manuscript of the incomplete Fifth Series of <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i> 
              has recently been published by Illinois University Press (1996). The 
              prefatory essay by the editors William Baker and J.H. Alexander provides 
              a useful introduction to the <i>Tales</i> as a whole.
