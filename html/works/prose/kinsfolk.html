            <p><img src="../../graphics/kinsfolk.jpg" alt="Field of Waterloo, engraved by W. Miller after J.M.W. Turner, 1835 (Corson A.13.COL.a.1834-6/16)" width="250" height="147" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">On hearing the news of the Allied victory at Waterloo (June 18,
              1815), Scott longed to visit the battlefield and to see newly conquered
              Paris. Continental Europe had been closed to British visitors during
              the Napoleonic Wars, and Scott had never before travelled abroad.
              In August, he set sail for Belgium, hoping to recuperate his expenses
              by writing a series of imaginary letters recording his impressions.
              Collected as <i>Paul's Letters to His Kinsfolk</i> (1816), these
               not only document Scott's personal reaction to the scenes he passed
              
              through, but provide a detailed history of Napoleon's last campaign
               based on interviews with participants and (not always reputable)
              
              eyewitnesses. Here, Scott is notably equitable in his treatment
               of the Emperor, acknowledging his military genius and regretting
              
              only that he chose not to lay down his own life along with his
              Guard.  A similarly non-partisan approach would later be adopted
              in Scott's 
              <a href="napoleon.html"> <i>Life of Napoleon Buonaparte</i></a> 
            (1827). </p>

            <h3><font color="#003366"><a name="synopsis" id="synopsis"></a>Synopsis</font></h3>            <p>Scott was amongst the first British civilians to view the battlefield
               at Waterloo, and provides in letters VII-VIII a close account
              of 
              the conflict. Contemporaneously, he subjected the same material
               to a poetic treatment in his <a href="../poetry/waterloo.html"><i>The
                Field of Waterloo</i></a>, a verse narrative published in aid
                of  a fund set up for widows and orphans of soldiers. In the <i>Letters</i>,
              Scott goes on to describe the scene of devastation on the battlefield,
              and the emergence of a tourist industry selling relics of the battle.
                Passing through Flanders, Scott describes the artistic and architectural
              treasures of its cities, but also devotes space to an analysis
              of
              the economic and political repercussions of its union with the
              Netherlands.</p>
            <table width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td width="58%">Crossing into France, Scott shows remarkably
                  little bitterness to the conquered enemy. He laments instead
                  the brutality of
                  the victorious Prussians while acknowledging that they had
                  been sorely provoked by harsh treatment at French hands. Proceeding
                  to Paris, Scott compares the behaviour and discipline of the
                  armies of the victorious, occupying powers and describes his
                  meetings with their leaders. Pride of place goes to Scott's
                  meeting with the Duke of Wellington (portrayed, right), whose
                  lack of conceit and pretension greatly impressed him. Wellington
                  provided
                  Scott
                  with much invaluable information for his descriptions of Waterloo
                  and Napoleon's last campaign, although subsequent commentators
                  have felt that Scott overstates Wellington's role at the expense
                of the Prussian Field-Marshall Bl&uuml;cher. </td>

              </tr>
            </table>                        <p>Scott goes on to analyse the state of the various parties in post-Napoleonic 
              France (royalists, imperialists, and liberals), noting the weakness 
              and instability of the restored Bourbon dynasty and foreseeing the 
              reaction that would bring it down. He is concerned by the apparent 
              decline in religious sentiment of the French people and perceives 
              a concomitant decay in morality.</p>

            <p>Upon his return to Scotland, Scott found writing up his travel 
              notes a wearisome chore and yearned to press ahead with his third 
              novel <i><a href="../novels/antiquary.html">The Antiquary</a></i>. 
              Published on January 25, 1816, the <i>Letters</i> were nonetheless 
              well received by the public, rapidly going through three editions. 
              For once, the reviews too were unanimously laudatory. Although the 
              volume appeared anonymously, none had any difficulty in recognizing 
              Scott as the author. Indeed, for the <i>Antijacobin Review</i>, 
              the <i>Letters</i> showed that Scott was 'a much better prose-writer 
              than a poet'. There was almost no adverse criticism, with the <i>Augustan 
              Review</i>, <i>British Critic</i>, <i>Gentleman's Review</i>, and 
              <i>Scots Magazine</i> being particularly fulsome in their praise. 
              Only the <i>Eclectic Review</i> took issue with Scot's analysis 
              of the religious state of France but still spoke of the <i>Letters</i> 
              as capable of giving 'much pleasure'.</p>
