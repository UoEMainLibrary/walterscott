                <td width="65%">In February 1830, Scott was recovering from a
                  first paralytic stroke. J.G. Lockhart, hoping to distract his
                  father-in-law from working on more arduous enterprises (preparing
                  the Magnum Opus and writing <i><a href="../novels/robert.html">Count
                  Robert of Paris</a></i>), suggested that he write a small volume
                  on witchcraft for 'Murray's Family Library'. As Scott had a
                  comprehensive collection of books on the subject immediately
                  to hand at <a href="../../biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a>,
                  Lockhart hoped that it would be a relatively easy project to
                  complete. Instead Scott, who enthusiastically greeted the idea,
                  merely added it to his task list. It was a theme that had fascinated
                  Scott since childhood. He had previously proposed collaborating
                  with Robert Surtees on a study of demonology in 1809, and with
                  Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe on a comic selection of supernatural
                  tales in 1812. In 1823, he had even written part of a dialogue
                  on popular superstitions which had failed to attract a sufficiently
                  enticing bid from Constable.</td>

            <p>Lockhart's suggestion was partly sparked by the interest raised
              by Robert Pitcairn's serial publication of <i>Criminal Trials of
              Scotland</i>, covering proceedings between 1487 and 1624, and featuring
              many cases of witchcraft. Pitcairn himself sent Scott transcripts
              of as yet unpublished trials, and many other students of the occult
              sent Scott source material on witchcraft while he was working on
              the <i>Letters</i>. In addition, he drew on earlier demonologies
              such as Reginald Scot's <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft</i>, Robert
              Kirk's<i> Essay on the Subterranean Commonwealth</i>, and Cotton
              Mather's <i>Magnalia Christi</i>. Scott's arguments against a supernatural
              explanation of such phenomena were influenced by John Ferriars's
              'Of Popular Illusions and More Particularly of Modern Demonology'
              and Thomas Jackson's <i>Treatise Containing the Originall of Un-beliefe</i>.
              Composition was rapid, with the volume complete by mid-July 1830,
              but Scott's interest waned long before the last page. It was published
              on September 14, 1830, with ten illustrations by George Cruickshank.</p>
            <p><font size="2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></font></p>
            <h3><font color="#003366"><a name="synopsis" id="synopsis"></a>Synopsis</font></h3>
            <p>The book takes the form of ten letters addressed to Lockhart,
              the epistolary mode permitting Scott to be both conversational
              in tone and discursive in method. In these, Scott surveys opinions
              respecting demonology and witchcraft from the Old Testament period
              to his own day. As a child of the Enlightenment, he adopts a rigorously
              rational approach to his subject. Supernatural visions are attributed
              to 'excited passion', to credulity, or to physical illness. The
              medieval belief in demons is based on Christian ignorance of other
              religions, leading to the conviction that the gods of the Muslim
              or Pagan nations were fiends and their priests conjurers or wizards.
              In the post-Reformation period, the primitive state of science
              and predominance of mystical explanations of natural phenomena
              fed fear of witchcraft. In the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
              witches were hunted with near-hysterical zeal. Examining Scottish
              criminal trials for witchcraft, Scott notes that the nature of
              evidence admissible gave free reign to accusers and left the accused
              no chance of escape. Prisoners were driven to confess through despair
              and the desire to avoid future persecution. Scott also observes
              that trials for witchcraft were increasingly connected with political
              crimes, just as in Catholic countries accusations of witchcraft
              and heresy went together. Advances in science and the spread of
              rational philosophy during the eighteenth century eventually undermined
              the belief in supernatural phenomena, although pockets of superstition
              remain. Scott's account is amply illustrated with anecdotes and
              traditional tales and may be read as an anthology of uncanny stories
              as much as a philosophical treatise.</p>

            <p>The <i>Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft</i> were an immediate
              commercial success, with Scott's sceptical attitude towards the
              supernatural sharply dividing his readers. Critical reaction was
              somewhat mixed. The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> and <i>Imperial
              Magazine</i> warmly commended the work, and the <i>Literary Gazette</i> judged
              it a 'most interesting volume for all ages', particularly apt to
              correct 'idle phantasies in the young'. The <i>Edinburgh Literary
              Journal </i>concurred that it was an 'interesting book' but did
              not think that 'Sir Walter has gone very deep into the theory of
              supernatural visitations, or thrown much light upon the origin
              of the belief in them'. The <i>Aberdeen Journal</i> too questioned
              the depth of Scott's scholarship, arguing that commercial considerations
              weighed heavier with him than the spirit of philosophical inquiry.<font size="2"></font> For
              the <i>Monthly Review</i>, conversely, the subject was devoid of
              all merit, a mere 'history of old women'. Subsequent scholars,
              however, have recognized the <i>Letters</i> as one of the earliest
              attempts to deal with magic and demonology in a scientific manner,
              pre-empting much late nineteenth-century research on folklore,
              ethnology, and popular religion.</p>
