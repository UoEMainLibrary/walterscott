		      <p align="left"><font size="4">My dear Sir George,&#8212;I received two
		          or three days since your interesting vindication of your opinion
		          respecting the vitrified forts against Dr Macculloch. I have
		          not seen as yet the Doctors letters so that I am not very competent
		          to judge nor perhaps should I be so were I to investigate the
		          matter as deeply as I could having no science to aid me.</font></p>
		      <p align="left"><font size="4">But I think our friend &amp; associate
		          cuts too short in disposing so very absolutely both of Lord
		          Woodhouselees opinion and of yours for I think your pamphlet
		          shows a strong probability that some of these structures at
		          least had been used as beacon stations. I cannot however think
		          that all of these were so because the only one which I ever
		          examined particularly with <em>spade &amp; shovel </em>was in a low
		          situation on the verge of a moss near Fettercairn a place totally
		          unfit for a signal light. Tradition terms this the Castle of
		          Fenella where Kenneth was murderd by that Lady &amp; adds that
		          [her?*] castle was burnd in revenge of the Kings death by the
		          royal followers. If this could be trusted it would go far to
		          shew that in one instance at least Woodhouselees explanation
		          had been just and that the vitrified [appearance arises from
		          accidental combustion.]</font></p>
