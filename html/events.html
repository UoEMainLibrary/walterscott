                <p><span data-ft="{'tn':'K'}">The   'Great Scott' campaign, developed by <a href="http://www.cityofliterature.com/">Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature Trust</a>, aims   not only to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the publication of   <a href="works/novels/waverley.html"><em>Waverley</em></a>, but also to mark the 10th anniversary of Edinburgh&rsquo;s   designation as the world&rsquo;s first UNESCO City of Literature. It is based in Edinburgh's Waverley Station, the only </span>railway station in the world named after a book.  In a collaboration with <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/">Network Rail</a>, quotations from Scott&rsquo;s writings will be written across the floors, windows and walkways of the  station bringing Scott&rsquo;s words alive for a new audience. As part  of the campaign, 25,000 copies of a free book, <em>Great Scott!, </em>will be given away in the station.<br>
Telling  the story of Scott&rsquo;s life, it includes a timeline, quotes, and musings, and gives tips on things to  see, read, and do relating to Scott.  The book is also available for download, in audio form, and as an ebook in many formats. The campaign website aims to be a 'virtual train ticket' to all that Scott contributed to Edinburgh, the Borders, the Scottish nation, and   world literature in general. New content will be added daily, including trails, videos, quotes and 'did you knows'.</p>

                <p>The year 1814 put an end to the Peninsular War in  Spain. A six-year period followed during which an authoritarian Ferdinand VII ruled, in an era  of great hostility towards liberal ideas. Triggered by Riego&rsquo;s revolutionary coup, three years  of tumultuous liberal and radical government ensued. This was of great concern to the  conservative European powers (Britain among them), who eventually agreed to intervene in  Spain by sending a French army. By the end of 1823, the old absolutist order had been  restored in Spain, and the subsequent months saw the end of Spanish rule in continental America. In Britain  as elsewhere in Europe, Romanticism was still in full production during those years. The &lsquo;second  generation&rsquo; poets, together with novelists like Mary Shelley, Jane Austen and Walter  Scott, published much of their best work in this period, which also inspired a substantial part of  Constable&rsquo;s and Turner&rsquo;s paintings. Many of these British artists and intellectuals were aware  of what was going on in Southern and Eastern Europe, where authoritarian regimes were  facing a number of consecutive and related revolutionary movements. This included Spain, whose  image in Britain had been constantly shifting for two decades --from foe to friend, heroic  to backward, war-winner to peace-loser, revolutionary to reactionary and back to  revolutionary.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the research objectives of <em>Anglo-Hispanic  Horizons</em>, papers were invited addressing the following topics:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>The 2015 International Conference of the <a href="http://www.bars.ac.uk/">British Association for Romantic Studies (BARS)</a> is hosted by the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/encap/">School of English, Communication &amp; Philosophy</a> and the <a href="https://cardiffbookhistory.wordpress.com/">Centre for Editorial and Intertextual Research</a> at <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/">Cardiff University</a>, Wales.  The   theme of the interdisciplinary conference is Romantic Imprints, broadly   understood to include the various literary, cultural, historical and   political manifestations of Romantic print culture across Europe, the   Americas and the rest of the world. The focus will fall on the ways in   which the culture of the period was conscious of itself as functioning   within and through, or as opposed to, the medium of print. The   conference location in the Welsh capital provides a special opportunity   to foreground the Welsh inflections of Romanticism within the remit of   the conference&rsquo;s wider theme. The two-hundredth anniversary of Waterloo   also brings with it the chance of thinking about how Waterloo was   represented within and beyond print.</p>
                <p>Confirmed keynote speakers are<strong> John Barrell</strong> (Queen Mary, London), <strong>James   Chandler</strong> (Chicago), <strong>Claire Connolly</strong> (Cork), <strong>Peter Garside</strong> (Edinburgh)   and <strong>Devoney Looser</strong> (Arizona State). Among many panels of potential Scott interest is <em>Editing Walter Scott&rsquo;s Poetry</em> led by <strong>Alison Lumsden</strong> and <strong>Ainsley McIntosh</strong> from Aberdeen University's <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/sll/research/walter-scott-research-centre/index.php">Walter Scott Research Centre</a>.</p>
