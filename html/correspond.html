            <p>This page will shortly be developed to provide a detailed biographical
              guide to Scott's principal correspondents. It currently presents
              images of some of the most significant items of Scott correspondence
              held in Edinburgh University Library's <a href="http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/lib/about/pubs/lg51/coll/laing.shtml">Laing
              Collection</a>. </p>
            <p>Those interested in Scott's correspondence will also wish to access
              the <a href="http://www.nls.uk/catalogues/resources/scott/index.cfm">Millgate
              Union Catalogue of Walter Scott Correspondence</a>. This resource,
              which provides for the first time records for the nearly 14,000
              letters written by or to Scott that have proved traceable worldwide
              in autograph, transcript, or printed form, has recently been made
              available by the National Library of Scotland.</p>

                    Maria Edgeworth, dated 14 November 1827. It is in reply to
                    a letter from Edgeworth thanking him for sending copies of <em><a href="works/novels/canongate.html">Chronicles
                    of the Canongate</a></em> and <em>Miscellaneous Prose Works</em>.
                    In response to Edgeworth's praise, Scott writes: &quot;Now
                    I claim credit as an honest man when I tell you that almost
                    all things I have written even those which the public has
                    received best have been so much inferior to that which I
                    would like to have done that I am always disgusted with them
                    for the time at least -- Years afterwards when the ideas
                    out of which the story was produced have been entirely forgotten
                    I have been much better pleased with them.&quot;</p>

                    and philosopher Sir George Steuart Mackenzie (1780-1848),
                    thanking him for sending his <em>A letter to Sir Walter Scott

                    singular remains, by Dr. Macculloch, in his recent publication
                    on the Highlands and Western Isles</em>. In his response,
                    Scott recalls excavations that he had personally conducted
                    in spring 1796 when staying at Sir John Belsches Wishart's
                    estate of Fettercairn (and courting Sir John's daughter <a href="biography/marriage.html">Williamina</a>).</p>
