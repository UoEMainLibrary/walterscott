		<h3>Glencoe, engraved by W. Miller after J.M.W. Turner (1836).</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From: <em>The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> Vol. 25 (Edinburgh:
	  Cadell, 1836). </p>
		<p>The Massacre of Glencoe took place on February 13, 1692. As an example
		  to the predominantly Jacobite Highland clans, a government order was
		  passed that all of the MacDonalds of Glencoe under seventy years of
		  age were to be slaughtered in punishment for their (unavoidably) late
		  compliance with an order to swear allegiance to William of Orange.
		  The clan were attacked by government soldiers, mainly belonging to
		  the rival clan Campbell, who had been quartered upon them. Thirty-eight
		  Macdonalds died, many surprised in their beds.</p>
