		<h3>Killiecrankie, engraved by W. Miller after J.M.W. Turner (1836).</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From: <em>The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> Vol. 25 (Edinburgh:
	  Cadell, 1836). </p>
		<p>On 27 July 1689, a Jacobite army led by John Graham of Claverhouse ('Bonnie
		  Dundee') defeated government forces under General Hugh Mackay at the
		  Pass of
		  Killiecrankie (near Pitlochry). Claverhouse himself, however, was killed
		  during the battle, as were one third of his soldiers, and the seriously
		  weakened Highlanders were subsequently defeated at the battle of Dunkeld.</p>
