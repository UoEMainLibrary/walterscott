		<h3>Edinburgh, engraved by W. Miller after J.M.W. Turner (1836).</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From: <em>The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> Vol. 22 (Edinburgh:
	  Cadell, 1836). </p>
		<p><br>
		  Founded as a fortress town by Edwin of Northumbria in 626, Edinburgh
		    was captured for Scotland by Malcolm II ('Malcolm Canmore') in 1018. Although
		    Dunfermline remained the nation's capital, Edinburgh rapidly became
		    its major metropolis. The city was occupied and the Castle sacked by Edward
		    I of England in 1296, but was retakened by the Scots in 1313. Robert the
		    Bruce granted Edinburgh a Royal Charter in 1329, and by the 16th
		    century, it had supplanted Dunfermline as capital of Scotland.<br>
