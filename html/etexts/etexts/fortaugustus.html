		<h3>Fort Augustus. Loch Ness. Engraved by W. Miller after J.M.W. Turner (1836).</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From: <em>The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> Vol. 26 (Edinburgh:
	  Cadell, 1836). </p>
		<p>Fort Augustus, on the banks of Loch Ness, was built by General Wade as a
		  garrison town for government troups following the Jacobite Rising of
		  1715. It was captured by the Jacobites during the 1745/46 uprising
		  but, following the defeat of Prince Charles Edward Stuart ('Bonnie
		  Prince Charlie')
		  at Culloden, became the base from which the Duke of Cumberland organized
		  a campaign of brutal repression. Little now remains of the 
		  fort, as its parts were used in the construction of a
		  Benedictine Abbey in 1876.</p>
