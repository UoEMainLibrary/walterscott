<BODY><PRE>&lt;T THE COVENANTER'S FATE&gt;
&lt;D 1799&gt;
&lt;P 696&gt;
And ne'er but once, my son, he says,
Was yon sad cavern trod, -
In persecution's iron days,
When the land was left by God.

From Bewlie bog, with slaughter red,
A wanderer hither drew,
And oft he stopt and turn'd his head,
As by fits the night wind blew;

For trampling round by Cheviot edge
Were heard the troopers keen,
And frequent from the Whitelaw ridge
The death-shot flash'd between.

The moonbeams through the misty shower
On yon dark cavern fell;
Through the cloudy night the snow gleam'd white,
Which sunbeam ne'er could quell.

'Yon cavern dark is rough and rude,
And cold its jaws of snow;
But more rough and rude are the men of blood,
That hunt my life below]

'Yon spell-bound den, as the aged tell,
Was hewn by demon's hands;
But I had lourd melle with the fiends of hell
Than with Clavers and his band.'

He heard the deep-mouth'd blood-hound bark,
He heard the horses neigh,
He plunged him in the cavern dark,
And downward sped his way.

Now faintly down the winding path
Came the cry of the faulting hound,
And the mutter'd oath of baulked wrath
Was lost in hollow sound.

He threw him on the flinted floor,
And held his breath for fear;
He rose and bitter cursed his foes,
As the sounds died on his ear:

'O bare thine arm, thou battling Lord,
For Scotland's wandering band;
Dash from the oppressor's grasp the sword,
And sweep him from the land]

'Forget not thou thy people's groans
From dark Dunnotter's tower,
Mix'd with the seafowl's shrilly moans,
And ocean's bursting roar]

'O, in fell Clavers' hour of pride,
Even in his mightiest day,
As bold he strides through conquest's tide,
O stretch him on the clay]

'His widow and his little ones,
O from their tower of trust
Remove its strong foundation stones,
And crush them in the dust]'

'Sweet prayers to me]' a voice replied;
'Thrice welcome, guest of mine]'
And glimmering on the cavern side
A light was seen to shine.

&lt;P 697&gt;
An aged man, in amice brown,
Stood by the wanderer's side;
By powerful charm, a dead man's arm
The torch's light supplied.

From each stiff finger, stretch'd upright,
Arose a ghastly flame,
That waved not in the blast of night
Which through the cavern came.

O, deadly blue was that taper's hue,
That flamed the cavern o'er,
But more deadly blue was the ghastly hue
Of his eyes who the taper bore.

He laid on his head a hand like lead,
As heavy, pale, and cold -
'Vengeance be thine, thou guest of mine,
If thy heart be firm and bold.

'But if faint thy heart, and caitiff fear
Thy recreant sinews know,
The mountain erne thy heart shall tear,
Thy nerves the hooded crow.'

The wanderer raised him undismay'd:
'My soul, by dangers steel'd,
Is stubborn as my border blade,
Which never knew to yeild.

'And if thy power can speed the hour
Of vengeance on my foes,
Theirs by the fate from bridge and gate
To feed the hooded crows.'

The Brownie look'd him in the face,
And his colour fled with speed -
'I fear me,' quoth he, 'uneath it will be
To match thy word with deed.

'In ancient days when English bands
Sore ravaged Scotland fair,
The sword and shield of Scottish land
Was valiant Halbert Kerr.

'A warlock loved the warrior well,
Sir Michael Scott by name,
And he sought for his sake a spell to make,
Should the Southern foemen tame.

' ''Look thou,'' he said, ''from Cessford head,
As the July sun sinks low,
And when glimmering white on Cheviot's height
Thou shalt spy a wreath of snow,
The spell is complete which shall bring to thy feet
The haughty Saxon foe.''

'For many a year wrought the wizard here,
In Cheviot's bosom low,
Till the spell was complete, and in July's heat
Appear'd December's snow;
But Cessford's Halbert never came
The wondrous cause to know.

'For years before in Bowden aisle
The warrior's bones had lain;
And after short while, by female guile,
Sir Michael Scott was slain.

'But me and my brethren in this cell
His mighty charms retain;
And he that can quell the powerful spell
Shall o'er broad Scotland reign.'

He led him through an iron door
And up a winding stair,
And in wild amaze did the wanderer gaze
On the sight which open'd there.

Through the gloomy night flash'd ruddy light, -
A thousand torches glow;
The cave rose high, like the vaulted sky,
O'er stalls in double row.

&lt;P 698&gt;
In every stall of that endless hall
Stood a steed in barbing bright;
At the foot of each steed, all arm'd save the head,
Lay stretch'd a stalwart knight.

In each mail'd hand was a naked brand;
As they lay on the black bull's hide,
Each visage stern did upwards turn,
With eyeballs fix'd and wide.

A launcegay strong, full twelve ells long,
By every warrior hung;
At each pommel there, for battle yare,
A Jedwood axe was slung.

The casque hung near each cavalier;
The plumes waved mournfully
At every tread which the wanderer made
Through the hall of gramarye.

The ruddy beam of the torches' gleam
That glared the warriors on,
Reflected light from armour bright,
In noontide splendour shone.

And onward seen in lustre sheen,
Still lengthening on the sight,
Through the boundless hall stood steeds in stall,
And by each lay a sable knight.

Still as the dead lay each horseman dread,
And moved nor limb nor tongue;
Each steed stood stiff as an earthfast cliff,
Nor hoof nor bridle rung.

No sounds through all the spacious hall
The deadly still divide,
Save where echoes aloof from the vaulted roof
To the wanderer's step replied.

At length before his wondering eyes,
On an iron column borne,
Of antique shape, and giant size,
Appear'd a sword and horn.

'Now choose thee here,' quoth his leader,
'Thy venturous fortune try;
Thy woe and weal, thy boot and bale,
In yon brand and bugle lie.'

To the fatal brand he mounted his hand,
But his soul did quiver and quail;
The life-blood did start to his shuddering heart,
And left him wan and pale.

The brand he forsook, and the horn he took
To 'say a gentle sound;
But so wild a blast from the bugle brast,
That the Cheviot rock'd around.

From Forth to Tees, from seas to seas,
The awful bugle rung;
On Carlisle wall, and Berwick withal,
To arms the warders sprung.

With clank and clang the cavern rang,
The steeds did stamp and neigh;
And loud was the yell as each warrior fell
Sterte up with hoop and cry.

'Woe, woe,' they cried, 'thou caitiff coward,
'That ever thou wert born]
Why drew ye not the knightly sword
Before ye blew the horn?'

The morning on the mountain shone,
And on the bloody ground,
Hurl'd from the cave with shiver'd bone,
The mangled wretch was found.

And still beneath the cavern dread,
Among the glidders grey,
A shapeless stone with lichens spread
Marks where the wanderer lay.

&lt;T FAREWELL TO THE MUSE&gt;
&lt;D 1822&gt;
&lt;P 746&gt;
&lt;V .&gt;
Enchantress, farewell, who so oft hast decoy'd me,
At the close of the evening through woodlands to roam,
Where the forester, 'lated, with wonder espied me
Explore the wild scenes he was quitting for home.
Farewell, and take with thee thy numbers wild speaking
The language alternate of rapture and woe:
Oh] none but some lover, whose heartstrings are breaking,
The pang that I feel at our parting can know.

Each joy thou couldst double, and when there came sorrow,
Or pale disappointment to darken my way,
What voice was like thine, that could sing of to-morrow,
Till forgot in the strain was the grief of to-day]

But when friends drop around us in life's weary waning,
The grief, Queen of Numbers, thou canst not assuage;
Nor the gradual estrangement of those yet remaining,
The languor of pain, and the chillness of age.

'Twas thou that once taught me, in accents bewailing,
To sing how a warrior lay stretch'd on the plain,
And a maiden hung o'er him with aid unavailing,
And held to his lips the cold goblet in vain;
As vain thy enchantments, O Queen of wild Numbers,
To a bard when the reign of his fancy is o'er,
And the quick pulse of feeling in apathy slumbers -
Farewell, then, Enchantress] I meet thee no more]

&lt;T Lay of the Last Minstrel&gt;
&lt;D 1830&gt;
&lt;H Canto Sixth&gt;
&lt;P 39&gt;
&lt;V I&gt;

Breathes there the man with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land]
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd
As home his footsteps he hath turn'd
From wandering on a foreign strand?
If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
For him no Minstrel raptures swell;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung.

&lt;T Lucy Ashton's Song; Bride of Lammermoor II&gt;
&lt;D 1819&gt;
&lt;P 775&gt;
Look not thou on beauty's charming,
Sit thou still when kings are arming,
Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,
Speak not when the people listens,
Stop thine ear against the singer,
From the red gold keep thy finger;
Vacant heart and hand and eye,
Easy live and quiet die.

&lt;H Introduction to Canto First&gt;

(To William Stewart Rose, Esq.
Ashestiel, Ettrick Forest.)

November's sky is chill and drear,
November's leaf is red and sear:
Late, gazing down the steepy linn,
That hems our little garden in,
Low it its dark and narrow glen
You scarce the rivulet might ken,
So thick the tangled greenwood grew,
So feeble trill'd the streamlet through:
Now, murmuring hoarse, and frequent seen
Through bush and brier, no longer green,
An angry brook, it sweeps the glade,
Brawls over rock and wild cascade,
And, foaming brown with doubled speed,
Hurries its waters to the Tweed.

 No longer Autumn's glowing red
Upon our forest hill is shed;
No more beneath the evening beam
Fair Tweed reflects their purple gleam;
Away hath pass'd the heather-bell
That bloom'd so rich on Needpath-fell;
Sallow his brow; and russet bare
Are now the sister-heights of Yair.

The sheep, before the pinching heaven,
To shelter'd dale and down are driven,
Where yet some faded herbage pines,
And yet a watery sunbeam shines:
In meek despondency they eye
The wither'd sward and wintry sky,
And far and beneath their summer hill,
Stray sadly by Glenkinnon's rill:
The shepherd shifts his mantle's fold,
And wraps him closer from the cold;
His dogs no merry circles wheel,
But shivering follow at his heel;
A cowering glance they often cast,
As deeper moans the gathering blast.

 My imps, though hardy, bold, and wild,
As best befits the mountain child,
Feel the sad influence of the hour,
And wail the daisy's vanished flower;
Their summer gambols tell, and mourn,
And anxious ask, -Will spring return,
And birds and lambs again be gay,
And blossoms clothe the hawthorn spray ?
 Yes, prattlers, yes; the daisy's flower
Again shall paint your summer bower;
Again the hawthorn shall supply
The garlands you delight to ties;
The lambs upon the lea shall bound,
The wild birds carol to the round,
And, while you frolic light as they,
Too short shall seem the summer day.

&lt;P 93&gt;
&lt;H THE CASTLE&gt;
&lt;V III&gt;
A distant trampling sound he hears;
He looks abroad, and soon appears
&lt;P 94&gt;
O'er Hornecliff-hill a plump of spears
 Beneath a pennon gay;
A horseman darting from the crowd,
Like lightning from a summer cloud,
Spurs on his mettled courses proud,
  Before the dark array.
Beneath the sable palisade,
That clos'd the Castle barricade,
  His bugle horn he blew;
The warder hasted from the wall,
And warn'd the Captain in the hall,
  For well the blast he knew;
And joyfully that knight did call,
To sewer, squire, and seneschal.

&lt;V IV&gt;
' Now broach ye a pipe of Malvoisie,
  Bring pasties of the doe,
And quickly make the entrance free,
And bid my heralds ready be,
And every minstrel sound his glee,
  And all our trumpets blow;
And from the platform, spare ye not
To fire a noble salvo-shot;
  Lord Marmion waits below]'
Then to the Castle's lower ward
  Sped forty yeomen tall,
The iron-studded gates unbarr'd,
Rais'd the portcullis' ponderous guard,
The lofty palisade unsparr'd
  And let the drawbridge fall.

&lt;V V&gt;
Along the bridge Lord Marmion rode,
Proudly his red-roan charger trode,
His helm hung at the saddlebow;
Well by his visage you might know
He was a stalworth knight, and keen,
And had in many a battle been;
The scar on his brown cheek reveal'd
A token of Bosworth field;
His eyebrow dark, and eye of fire,
Show'd spirit proud, and prompt to ire;
Yet lines of thought upon his cheek
Did deep design and counsel speak.
His forehead, by his casque worn bare,
His thick mustache, and curly hair,
Coal-black, and grizzled here and there,
  But more through toil than age;
His square-turn'd joints, and strength of limb,
Show'd him no carpet knight so trim,
But in close fight a champion grim,
  In camps a leader sage.

&lt;V VI&gt;
Well was he arm'd from head to heel,
In mail and plate of Milan steel;
But his strong helm, of mighty cost,
Was all with burnish'd gold emboss'd;
Amid the plunge of the crest,
A falcon hover'd on her nest,
With wings outspread, and forward breast;
E'en such a falcon, on his shield,
Soar'd sable in an azure field:
The golden legend bore aright,
Who checks at me, to death is bright.
Blue was the charger's broider'd rein;
Blue ribbons deck'd his arching mane;
The knightly housing's ample fold
Was velvet blue, and trapp'd with gold.

&lt;V VII&gt;
Behind him rode two gallant squires,
Of noble name, and knightly sires;
They burn'd the glided spurs to claim;
For well could each a war-horse tame,
Could draw the bow, the sword he could sway,
And lightly bear the ring away;
Nor less with courteous precepts stor'd,
Could dance in hall, and carve at board,
And frame love-ditties passing rare,
And sing them to a lady fair.

&lt;P 98&gt;
&lt;V XXII&gt;
Young Selby, at the fair hall-board,
Carv'd to his uncle and that lord,
And reverently took up the word:
'Kind uncle, woe were we each one,
If harm should hap to brother John.
He is a man of mirthful speech,
Can many a game and gambol teach;
Full well at tables can he play,
And sweep at bowls the stake away.
None can a lustier carol bawl,
The needfullest among us all,
When time hangs heavy in the hall,
And snow comes thick at Christmastide,
And we can neither hunt, nor ride
A foray on the Scottish side.
The vow'd revenge of Bughtrig rude,
May end in worse than loss of hood.
Let Friar John, in safety, still
In chimney-corner snore his fill,
Roast hissing crabs, or flagons swill:
Last night, to Norham there came one,
Will better guide Lord Marmion.'
'Nephew,' quoth Heron, 'by my fay,
Well hast thou spoke; say forth thy say.'

&lt;V XXIII&gt;
'Here is a holy Palmer come,
From Salem first, and last from Rome;
One that hath kiss'd the blessed tomb,
And visited each holy shrine
In Araby and Palestine;
On hills of Armenie hath been,
Where Noah's ark may yet be seen;
By that Red Sea, too, hath he trod,
Which parted at the prophet's rod;
In Sinai's wilderness he saw
The Mount, where Israel heard the law,
'Mid thunder-dint, and flashing levin,
And shadows, mists, and darkness, given.
He shows Saint James's cockle-shell;
Of fair Montserrat, too, can tell;
  And of that Grot where olives nod,
Where, darling of each heart and eye,
From all the youth of Sicily
  Saint Rosalie retired to God.

&lt;V XXIV&gt;
'To stout Saint George of Norwich merry,
Saint Thomas, too, of Canterbury,
Cuthbert of Durham and Saint Bede,
For his sins' pardon hath he pray'd.
He knows the passes of the North,
And seeks far shrines beyond the Forth;
Little he eats, and long will wake,
And drinks but of the stream or lake.
This were a guide o'er moor and dale;
But, when our John hath quaff'd his ale,
&lt;P 99&gt;
As little as the wind that blows,
And warms itself against his nose,
Kens He, or cares, which way he goes,'

&lt;V XXV&gt;
'Gramercy]' quoth Lord Marmion,
'Full loth were I, that Friar John,
That venerable man, for me,
Were placed in fear or jeopardy.
If this same Palmer will me lead
  From hence to Holy-rood,
Like his good saint, I'll pay his meed,
Instead of cockle-shell, or bead,
  With angels fair and good.
I love such holy ramblers; still
They know to charm a weary hill,
  With song, romance, or lay:
Some jovial tale, or glee, or jest,
Some lying legend, at the least,
  They bring to cheer the way.'

&lt;V XXVI&gt;
'Ah] noble sir,' young Selby said,
And finger on his lip he laid,
'This man knows much, perchance e'en more
Than he could learn by holy lore.
Still to himself he's muttering,
And shrinks as at some unseen thing.
Last night we listen'd at his cell;
Strange sounds we heard, and sooth to tell,
He murmur'd on till morn, howe'er
No living mortal could be near.
Sometimes I thought I heard it plain,
As other voices spoke again.
I cannot tell; I like it not;
Frair John hath told us it is wrote
No conscience clear and void of wrong
Can rest awake and pray so long.
Himself still sleeps before his beads
Have mark'd ten aves, and two creeds.'

&lt;P 102&gt;
&lt;H Introduction to Canto Second&gt;
&lt;V II&gt;
She could not glide along the air
With form more light, or face more fair.
No more the widow's deafen'd ear
Grows quick that lady's step to hear:
At noontide she expects her not,
Nor busies her to trim the cot;
Pensive she turns her humming wheel,
Or pensive cooks her orphans meal;
Yet blesses. ere she deals their bread,
The gentle hand by which they're fed.

&lt;V III&gt;
  From yair-which hills so closely bind,
Scarce can the Tweed his passage find,
Though much he fret and chafe and toil
Till all his eddying currents boil,-
Her long-descended lord has gone,
And left us by the stream alone.
And much I miss those sportive boys,
Companions of my mountain joys,
Just at the age 'twixt boy and youth,
When thought is speech, and speech is truth.
Close to my side, with what delight
They press'd to hear of Wallace wight,
When, pointing to his airy mound,
I call'd his ramparts holy ground]
Kindled their brows to hear me speak;
And I have smiled, to feel my cheek,
Despite the difference of our years,
Return again the glow of theirs.
Ah, happy boys] such feelings pure,
They will not, cannot, long endure;
Condemn'd to stem the world's rude tide,
You may not linger by the side;
For Fate shall thrust you from the shore,
And passion ply the sail and oar.
Yet cherish the remembrance still,
Of the lone mountain, and the rill;
For trust, dear boys, the time will come,
When fiercer transport shall be dumb,
And you will think right frequently,
But, well I hope, without a sigh,
On the free hours that we have spent
Together on the brown hill's bent.

&lt;V IV&gt;
  When musing on campanions gone,
We doubly feel ourselves alone,
Something, my friend, we yet may gain;
There is a pleasure in this pain:
It soothes the love of lonely rest,
Deep in each gentler heart impress'd.
'Tis silent amid worldly toils,
And stifled soon by mental broils;
But, in a bosom thus prepar'd,
Its still small voice is often heard,
Whispering a mingled sentiment,
'Twixt resignation and content.
Oft in my mind such thoughts awake,
By lone Saint Mary's silent lake;
Thou know'st it well,-nor fen, nor sedge,
Pollute the pure lake's crystal edge;
Abrupt and sheer, the mountains sink
At once upon the level brink;
And just a trace of silver sand
Marks where the water meets the land.
Far in the mirror, bright and blue,
Each hill's huge outline you may view;
Shaggy with heath, but lonely bare,
Nor tree, nor bush, nor brake, is there,
Save where, of land, yon slender line
Bears thwart the lake the scatter'd pine.
Yet even the nakedness has power,
And aids the feeling of the hour:
Nor thicket, dell, nor copse you spy,
Where living thing conceal'd might lie;
Nor point, retiring, hides a dell,
Where swain, or woodman lone, might dwell;
There's nothing left to fancy's guess,
You see that all is loneliness:
And silence aids-through the steep hills
Send to the lake a thousand rills;
In summer tide, so soft they weep,
The sound but lulls the ear asleep:
Your horse's hoof-tread sounds too rude,
So stilly is the solitude.

&lt;P 106&gt;
&lt;H The Convent&gt;
&lt;V IX&gt;
The tide did now its flood mark gain,
And girdled in the Saints domain:
For, with the flow and ebb, its style
Varies from continent to isle;
Dry shod, o'er sands, twice every day,
The pilgrims to the shrine find way;
Twice every day, the waves efface
Of staves and sandall'd feet the trace.
As to the port the galley flew,
Higher and higher rose to view
The Castle with its battled walls,
The ancient Monastery's halls,
A solemn, huge, and dark-red pile,
Plac'd on the margin of the isle.

&lt;V X&gt;
In Saxon strength that Abbey frown'd,
With massive arches broad and round,
  That rose alternate, row and row,
  On ponderous columns, short and low,
  Built ere that art was known,
  By pointed aisle, and shafted stalk,
  The arcades of an alley'd walk
   To emulate in stone.
On the deep walls, the heathen Dane
Had pour'd his impious rage in vain;
And needful was such strength to these
Expos'd to the tempestuous seas,
Scourg'd by the winds' eternal sway,
Open to rovers fierce as they,
Which could twelve hundred years withstand
Winds, waves, and northern pirates' hand.
Not but that portions of the pile,
Rebuilded in a later style,
Show'd where the spoilers hand had been;
Not but the wasting sea-breeze keen
Had worn the pillar's carving quaint,
And moulder'd in his niche the saint,
And rounded, with consuming power,
The pointed angles of each tower;
Yet still entire the Abbey stood,
Like veteran, worn, but unsubdu'd.

&lt;V XI&gt;
Soon as they near'd his turrets strong,
The maidens rais'd Saint Hilda's song,
  And with the sea-wave and the wind,
  Their voices, sweetly shrill, combin'd,
   And made harmonious close;
  Then, answering from the sandy shore,
  Half-drown'd amid the breakers' roar,
   According chorus rose:
Down to the haven of the Isle,
The monks and nuns in order file,
  From Cuthbert's cloisters grim;
Banner, and cross, and relics there,
To meet Saint Hilda's maids, they bare;
And, as they caught the sounds on air,
  They echo'd back the hymn.
The islanders, in joyous mood,
Rush'd emulously through the flood,
&lt;P 107&gt;
  To hale the bark to land;
Conspicuous by her veil and hood,
Signing the cross, the Abbess stood,
  And bless'd them with her hand.

&lt;V XII&gt;
Suppose we now the welcome said,
Suppose the Convent banquet made:
  All through the holy dome,
Through cloister, aisle, and gallery,
Wherever vestal maid might pry.
Nor risk to meet unhallow'd eye,
  The stranger sisters roam,-
Till fell the evening damp with dew,
And the sharp sea-breeze coldly blew,
For there, even summer night is chill.
Then, having stray'd and gaz'd their fill,
  They clos'd around the fire;
And all, in turn, essay'd to paint,
  A theme that ne'er can tire
A holy maid; for, be it known,
That their saint's honour is their own.

&lt;P 110&gt;
&lt;V XXIV&gt;
These executioners were chose,
As men who were with mankind foes,
And, with despite and envy fir'd,
Into the cloister had retir'd;
  Or who in desperate doubt of grace,
  Strove, by deep penance, to efface
   Of some foul crime the stain;
  For, as the vassals of her will,
Such men the Church selected still,
  As either joy'd in doing ill,
   Or thought more grace to gain,
If, in her cause, they wrestled down
Feelings their nature strove to own.
By strange device were they brought there,
They knew not how, nor knew not where.

&lt;V XXV&gt;
And now that blind old Abbot rose,
  To speak the Chapter's doom,
On those the wall was to enclose,
  Alive, within the tomb;
But stopp'd, because that woful Maid,
Gathering her powers, to speak essay's.
Twice she essay'd, and twice in vain;
Her accents might no utterance gain;
Nought but imperfect murmurs slip
From her convuls'd and quivering lip;
  'Twixt each attempt all was so still,
  You seem'd to hear a distant rill;
   'Twas ocean's swells and falls;
  For though this vault of sin and fear
Was to the sounding surge so near,
A tempest there you scarce could hear,
So massive were the walls.

&lt;V XXVI&gt;
At length, an effort sent apart
The blood that curdled to her heart,
  And light came to her eye,
And colour dawn'd upon her cheek,
A hectic and a flutter's streak,
Like that left on the Cheviot peak,
  By Autumn's stormy sky;
And when her silence broke at length,
Still as she spoke she gather'd strength,
  And arm'd herself to bear.
It was a fearful sight to see
Such high resolve and constancy
 In form so soft and fair.

&lt;V XXVII&gt;
'I speak not to implore your grace,-
Well know I, for one minute's space
  Successless might I sue:
Nor do I speak your prayers to gain;
For if a death of lingering pain,
To cleanse my sins, be penance vain,
  Vain are your masses too.
I listen'd to a traitor's tale,
I left the convent and the veil;
For three long years I bow'd my pride,
A horse-boy in his train to ride;
And well my folly's meed he gave,
Who forfeited, to be his slave,
All here, and all beyond the grave.
He saw young Clara's face more fair,
He knew her of broad lands the heir,
Forgot his vows, his faith forswore,
And Constance was belov'd no more.
  'Tis an old tale. and often told;
   But did my fate and wish agree,
 Ne'er had been read, in story old,
 Of maiden true betray'd for gold,
   That lov'd, or was aveng'd, like me]

From the pale willow snatch'd the treasure,
And swept it with a kindred measure,
Till Avon's swans, while rung the grove
with Montfort's hate and Basil's love,
Awakening at the inspired strain,
Deem'd their own Shakespeare liv'd again.'

&lt;V VI&gt;
 The friendship thus thy judgment wronging
With praises not to me belonging,
In task more meet for mightiest powers
Wouldst thou engage my thriftless hours.
But say, my Erskine, hast thou weigh'd
That secret power by all obey'd,
Which warps not less the passive mind,
Its source conceal'd or undefin'd;
Whether an impulse, that has birth
Soon as the infant wakes on earth,
One with our feelings and our powers,
And rather part of us than ours;
Or whether fitlier term'd the sway
Of habit, form'd in early day?
Howe'er deriv'd, its force confest
Rules with despotic sway the breast,
And drags us on by viewless chain,
While taste and reason plead in vain.
Look east, and ask the Belgian why,
Beneath Batavia's sultry sky,
He seeks not eager to inhale
The freshness of the mountain gale,
Content to rear his whiten'd wall
Beside the dank and dull canal?
He'll say, from youth he loved to see
The white sail gliding by the tree.
Or see yon weatherbeaten hind,
Whose sluggish herds before him wind,
Whose tatter'd plaid and rugged cheek
His northern clime and kindred speak;
Through England's laughing meads he goes
And England's wealth around him flows;
Ask, if it would content him well,
At ease in those gay plains to dwell,
Where hedge-rows spread a verdant screen,
And spires and forests intervene,
And the neat cottage between?
No] not for these will he exchange
His dark Lochaber's boundless range;
Not for fair Devon's meads forsake
Ben Nevis grey, and Garry's lake.

  Thus while I ape the measure wild
Of tales that charm'd me yet a child,
Rude through they be, still with the chime
Return the thoughts of early time;
And feelings, rous'd in life's first day,
Glow in the line, and prompt the lay.
Then rise those crags, that mountain tower
Which charm'd my fancy's wakening hour.
Though no broad river swept along,
To claim, perchance, heroic song:
Though sigh'd no groves in summer gale,
To prompt of love a softer tale;
Though scarce a puny streamlet's speed
Claim'd homage from a shepherd's reed;
Yet was poetic impulse given,
By the green hill and clear blue heaven.
It was a barren scene, and wild,
Where naked cliffs were rudely pil'd;
But ever and anon between
Lay velvet tufts of loveliest green;
And well the lonely infant knew
Recesses where the wall-flower grew,
And honey-suckle lov'd to crawl
Up the low crag and ruin'd wall.
I deem'd such nooks the sweetest shade
The sun in all its round survey'd;
And still I thought that shatter'd tower
The mightiest work of human power;
And marvell'd as the aged hind
With some strange tale bewitch'd my mind,
&lt;P 115&gt;
Of forayers, who, with headlong force,
Down from that strength had spurr'd their horse,
Their southern rapine to renew,
Far in the distant Cheviots blue,
And, home returning, fill'd the hall
With revel, wassel-rout, and brawl.

&lt;P 119&gt;
&lt;H The Hostel, or Inn&gt;

Well might he falter] By his aid
Was Constance Beverley betray'd.
Not that he augur'd of the doom,
Which on the living closed the tomb;
But, tired to hear the desperate maid
Threaten by turns, bespeech, upbraid;
And wroth, because in wild despair,
She practis'd on the life of Clare;
Its fugitive the Church he gave,
Though not a victim, but a slave;
And deem'd  restraint in convent strange
Would hide her wrongs, and her revenge.
Himself, proud Henry's favourite peer,
Held Romish thunders idle fear,
Secure his pardon he might hold,
For some slight mulct of penance-gold.
Thus judging, he gave secret way,
When the stern priests surpris'd their prey.
His train but deem'd the favourite page
Was left behind, to spare his age;
Or other if they deem'd, none dar'd
To mutter what he thought and heard:
Woe to the vassal, who durst pry
Into Lord Marmion's privacy]

&lt;V XVI&gt;
His conscience slept-he deem'd her well,
And safe secured in distant cell;
But, waken'd by her favourite lay,
And that strange Palmer's boding say,
That fell so ominous and drear
Full on the object of his fear
To aid remorse's venom'd throes,
Dark tales of convent-vengeance rose;
And constance, late betray'd and scorn'd.
All lovely on his soul return'd;
Lovely as when, at treacherous call,
She left her convent's peaceful wall,
Crimson'd with shame, with terror mute,
Dreading alike escape, pursuit,
Till love, victorious o'er alarms,
Hid fears and blushes in his arms.

&lt;V XVII&gt;
'Alas]' he thought, 'how changed that mien]
How changed these timid looks have been,
Since years of guilt, and of diguise,
Have steel'd her brow, and arm'd her eyes]
No more of virgin terror speaks
The blood that mantles in her cheeks;
Fierce, and unfeminine, are there,
Frenzy for joy, for grief despair;
And I cause-for whom were given
Her peace on earth, her hopes in heaven]
Would,' thought he, as the picture grows,
'I on its stalk had left the rose]
Oh, why should man's success remove
The very charms that wake his love]
Her convent's peaceful solitude
Is now a prison harsh and rude;
And, pent within the narrow cell,
How will her spirit chafe and swell]
How brook the stern monastic laws]
The penance how-and I the cause]
Vigil and scourge-perchance even worse]'
And twice he rose to cry, 'To horse]'
And twice his sovereign's mandate came,
Like damp upon a kindling flame;
And twice he thought, 'Gave I not charge
She should be safe, though not at large?
They durst not, for their island, shred
One golden ringlet from her head.'

&lt;P 122&gt;
&lt;V XXV&gt;
'The joyful King turn'd home again,
Headed his host, and quell'd the Dane;
But yearly, when return'd the night
Of his strange combat with the sprite,
  His wound must bleed and smart;
Lord Gifford then would gibing say,
''Bold as ye were, my liege, ye pay
  The penance of your start.''
Long since, beneath Dunfermline's nave,
King Alexander fills his grave;
  Our Lady give him rest]
Yet still the knightly spear and shield
The Elfin Warrior doth wield,
  Upon the brown hill's breast;
And many a knight hath prov'd his chance,
In the charm'd ring to break a lance,
  But all have foully sped;
Save two, as legends tell, and they
Were Wallace wight and Gilbert Hay.
  Gentles, my tale is said.'

&lt;V XXVI&gt;
The quaighs were deep, the liquor strong,
And on the tale the yeoman-throng
Had made a comment sage and long,
  But Marmion gave a sign:
And, with their lord, the squires retire;
The rest, around the hostel fire,
  Their drowsy limbs recline;
For pillow, underneath each head,
The quiver and the targe were laid.
Deep slumbering on the hostel floor,
Oppress'd with toil and ale, they snore:
The dying flame, in fitful change,
Threw on the group its shadows strange.

&lt;V XXVII&gt;
Apart, and nestling in the hay
Of a waste loft, Fitz-Eustace lay;
Scarce, by the pale moonlight, were seen
The foldings of his mantle green:
Lightly he dreamt, as youth will dream,
Of sport by thicket, or by stream;
Of hawk or hound, of ring or glove,
Or lighter yet,  of lady's love.
A cautious tread his slumber broke,
And, close beside him, when he woke,
In moonbeam half, and half in gloom,
Stood a tall form, with nodding plume;
But, ere his dagger Eustace drew,
His master Marmion's voice he knew.

&lt;V XXVIII&gt;
'Fitz-Eustace] rise, I cannot rest;
Yon churl's wild legend haunts my breast,
&lt;P 123&gt;
And graver thoughts have chafed my mood:
The air must cool my feverish blood;
And fain would I ride forth, to see
The scene of elfin chivalry.
Arise, and saddle me my steed;
And, gentle Eustace, take good heed
Thou dost not rouse these drowsy slaves;
I would not, that the prating knaves
Had cause for saying, o'er their ale,
That I could credit such a tale.'-
Then softly down the steps they slid,
Eustace the stable door undid,
And, darkling, Marmion's steed array'd,
While, whispering, thus the Baron said:-

&lt;P 125&gt;
&lt;H Introduction to Canto Fourth&gt;
&lt;V VI&gt;
 To thee, perchance, this rambling strain
Recalls our summer walks again:
&lt;P 126&gt;
When, doing nought-and, to speak true,
Not anxious to find aught to do -
The wild unbounded hills we rang'd,
While oft our talk its topic chang'd,
And, desultory as our way,
Rang'd, unconfin'd, from grave to gay.
Even when it flagg'd, as oft will chance,
No effort made to break its trance,
We could right pleasantly pursue
Our sports in social silence too;
Thou gravely labouring to portray
The blighted oak's fantastic spray;
I spelling o'er, with much delight,
The legend of that antique knight,
Tirante by name, yclep'd the White.
At either's feet a trusty squire,
Pandour and Camp, with eyes of fire,
Jealous, each other's motions view'd,
And scarce suppress'd their ancient feud.
The laverock whistled from the cloud;
The stream was lively, but not loud;
From the white thorn the May-flower shed
Its dewy fragrance round our head:
Not Ariel lived more merrily
Under the blossom'd bough, than we.

&lt;V VII&gt;
 And blithesome nights, too, have been ours,
When Winter stript the summer's bowers.
Careless we heard, what now I hear,
The wild blast sighing deep and drear,
When fires were bright, and lamps beam'd gay,
And ladies tun'd the lovely lay;
And he was held a laggard soul,
Who shunn'd to quaff the sparkling bowl.
Then he, whose absence we deplore,
Who breathes the gales of Devon's shore,
The longer miss'd, bewail'd the more;
And thou, and I, and ear-loved Rae,
And one whose name I may not say,-
For not Mimosa's tender tree
Shrinks sooner from the touch than he,-
In merry chorus well combin'd,
With laughter drown'd the whistling wind.
Mirth was within; and Care without
Might gnaw her nails to hear her shout.
Not but amid the buxom scene
Some grave discourse might intervene -
Of the good horse that bore him best,
His shoulder, hoof, and arching crest:
For, like mad Tom's, our chiefest care,
Was horse to ride, and weapon wear.
Such nights we've had; and, though the game
Of manhood be more sober tame,
And though the field-day, or the drill,
Seem less important now-yet still
Such may we hope to share again.
The sprightly thought inspires my strain]
And mark, how, like a horseman true,
Lord Marmion's march I thus renew.

&lt;P 130&gt;
&lt;H The Camp&gt;
&lt;V XIII&gt;
And here two days did Marmion rest,
  With every rite that honour claims
Attended as the King's own guest:-
  Such the command of Royal James,
Who marshall'd then his land's array,
Upon the Borough-moor that lay.
Perchance he would not foeman's eye
Upon his gathering host should pry,
Till full prepar'd was every band
To march against the English land.
Here while they dwelt, did Lindesay's wit
Oft cheer the Baron's moodier fit;
And, in his turn, he knew to prize
Lord Marmion's powerful mind, and wise,-
Train'd in the lore of Rome and Greece,
And policies of war and peace.

&lt;V XIV&gt;
It chanc'd, as fell the second night,
  That on the battlements they walk'd,
And, by the slowly fading light,
  Of varying topics talk'd;
And, unware, the Herald-bard
Said Marmion might his toil have spar'd,
  In travelling so far;
For that a messenger from heaven
In vain to James and counsel given
  Against the English war;
And. closer question'd, thus he told
A tale which chronicles of old
In Scottish story have enroll'd:-

&lt;V XV&gt;
   SIR DAVID LINDESAY'S TALE.
'Of all the palaces so fair,
  Built for the royal dwelling,
In Scotland, far beyond compare
  Linlithgow is excelling;
And in its park in jovial June,
How sweet the merry linnet's tune,
  How blithe the blackbird's lay]
The wild-buck bells from ferny brake,
The coot dives merry on the lake;
The saddest heart might pleasure take
  to see all the nature gay.
But June is to our sovereign dear
The heaviest month in all the year:
Too well his cause of grief you know,
June saw his father's overthrow.
Woe to the traitors, who could bring
The princely boy against his King]
Still in his conscience burns the sting.
In offices as strict as lent,
King James's June is ever spent.

&lt;V XVI&gt;
'When last this ruthful month was come
And in Linlithgow's holy dome
  The King, as wont, was praying;
While, for his royal father's soul,
The chanters sung, the bells did toll,
  The Bishop mass was saying -
For now the year brought round again
The day the luckless King was slain -
  In Katharine's aisle the Monarch knelt,
  With sackcloth-shirt, and iron belt,
   And eyes with sorrow streaming;
  Around him in their stalls of state,
  The Thistle's Knight-Companions sate,
   Their banners o'er them beaming.
&lt;P 131&gt;
I too was there, and, sooth to tell,
Bedeafen'd with the jangling knell,
Was watching where the sunbeams fell,
  Through the stain'd casement gleaming;
But, while I mark'd what next befell,
  It seem'd as I were dreaming.
Stepp'd from the crowd a ghostly wight,
In azure gown, with cincture white;
His forehead bald, his head was bare,
Down hung at length his yellow hair.
Now, mock me not, when,good my Lord,
I pledge to you my knightly word,
That, when I saw his placid grace,
His simple majesty of face,
His solemn bearing, and his pace
  So stately gliding on,
Seem'd to me ne'er did limner paint
So just an image of the Saint
Who propp'd the Virgin in her faint,
  The loved Apostle John]

&lt;P 134&gt;
&lt;V XXVII&gt;
Thin curling in the morning air,
The wreaths of failing declare
To embers now the brands decay'd,
Where the night-watch their fires had made.
They saw, slow rolling on the plain,
Full many a baggage-cart and wain,
And dire artillery's clumsy car,
By sluggish oxen tugg'd to war;
And there were Borthwick's Sisters Seven,
And culverins which France had given.
Ill-omen'd gift] the guns remain
The conqueror's spoil on Flodden plain.

&lt;V XXVIII&gt;
Nor mark'd they less, where in the air
A thousand streamers flaunted fair;
  Various in shape, device, and hue,
  Green, sanguine, purple, red, and blue,
Broad, narrow, swallow-tail's, and square,
Scroll, pennon, pensil, bandrol, there
  O'er the pavilions flew.
Highest and midmost, was descried
The royal banner floating wide;
  The staff, a pine-tree, strong and straight,
Pitch'd deeply in a massive stone,
Which still in memory is shown,
 Yet bent beneath the standard's weight
   Whene'er the western wind unroll'd,
   With toil, the huge and cumbrous fold,
And gave to view the dazzling field,
Where, in proud Scotland's royal shield,
   The ruddy lion ramp'd in gold.

&lt;V XXIX&gt;
Lord Marmion view'd the landscape bright,
He view'd it with a chief's delight,
  Until within him burn'd his heart,
  And lightning from his eye did part,
   As on the battle-day;
  Such glance did falcon never dart,
   When stooping on his prey.
'Oh] well, Lord-Lion, hast thou said,
Thy King from warfare to dissuade
  Were but a vain essay;
For, by St. George, were that host mine,
Not power infernal nor divine,
Should once to peace my soul incline,
Till I had dimm'd their armour's shine
In glorious battle-fray]'
Answer'd the Bard, of milder mood:
'Fair is the sight,-and yet 'twere good,
  That Kings would think withal,
When peace and wealth their land has bless'd,
'Tis better to sit still at rest.
  Than rise, perchance to fall.'

&lt;V XXX&gt;
Still on the spot Lord Marmion stay'd,
For fairer scene he ne'er survey'd.
  When sated with the martial show
  That peopled all the plain below,
  The wandering eye could o'er it go,
  And mark the distant city glow
   With gloomy splendour red;
  For on the smoke-wreaths, huge and slow,
  That round her sable turrets flow,
   The morning beams were shed,
  And ting'd them with a lustre proud,
  Like that which streaks a thundercloud.
Such dusky grandeur cloth'd the height,
Where the huge Castle holds its state,
  And all the steep slope down,
&lt;P 135&gt;
Whose ridgy back heaves to the sky,
Pil'd deep and massy, close and high,
  Mine own romantic town]
But northward far, with purer blaze,
On Ochil mountains fell the rays.
And as each healthy top they kiss'd,
It gleam'd a purple amethyst.
Yonder the shores of Fife you saw;
Here Preston-Bay and Berwick-Law:
  And, broad between them roll'd,
The gallant Frith the eye might note,
Whose islands on its bosom float,
  Like emeralds chas'd in gold.
Fitz-Eustace' heart felt closely pent;
As if to give his charger lent,
  And rais'd his bridle hand,
And, making demi-volte in air,
Cried 'Where's the coward that would not dare
 To fight for such a land]'
The Lindesay smil'd his joy to see;
Nor Marmion's frown repress'd his glee.

&lt;P 138&gt;
&lt;H The Court&gt;
&lt;V I&gt;
The train has left the hills of Braid;
The barrier guard have open made
(So Lindesay bade) the palisade,
  That closed the tented ground;
Their men the warders backward drew,
And carried pikes, as they rode through
  Into its ample bound.
Fast ran the Scottish warriors there,
Upon the Southern band to stare,
And envy with their wonder rose,
To see such well-appointed foes;
Such length of shafts, such mighty bows,
So huge, that many simply thought
But for a vaunt such weapons wrought;
And little deem'd their force to feel,
Through links of mail, and plates of steel,
When rattling upon Flodden vale,
The cloth-yard arrows flew like hail.

&lt;V II&gt;
Nor less did Marmion's skilful view
Glance every line and squadron through;
And much he marvell'd one small land
Could marshal forth such various band:
  For men -at-arms were here,
Heavily sheath'd in mail and plate,
Like iron towers for strength and weight,
On Flemish steeds of bone and height,
  With battle-axe and spear.
Young knights and squires, a lighter train,
Practis'd their chargers on the plain,
By aid of leg, of hand, and rein,
  Each warlike feat to show,
To pass, to wheel, the croupe to gain,
And high curvett, that not in vain
The sword sway might descend amain
  On foeman's casque below.
&lt;P 139&gt;
He saw the hardy burghers there
March arm'd, on foot, with faces bare,
  For vizor they wore none,
Nor waving plume, nor crest of knight;
But burnish'd were their corslets bright,
Their brigantines, and gorgets light,
  Like very silver shone.
Long pikes they had for standing fight,
  Two-handed swords they wore,
And many wielded mace of weight,
  And bucklers bright they bore.

&lt;V III&gt;
On foot the yeoman too, but dress'd
In his steel-jack, a swarthy vest,
  With iron quilted well;
Each at his back (a slender store)
His forty days' provision bore,
  As feudal statutes tell.
His arms were halbert , axe, or spear,
A crossbow there, a hagbut here,
  A dagger-knife, and brand.
Sober he seem'd, and sad of cheer,
As loth to leave his cottage dear,
  And march to foreign strand;
Or musing, who would guide his steer
  To till the fallow land.
Yet deem not in his thoughtful eye
Did aught of dastard terror lie;
  More dreadful far his ire,
Than theirs, who, scorning danger's name,
In eager mood to battle came,
Their valour like light straw on flame,
  A fierce but fading fire.

&lt;P 142&gt;
&lt;V XII&gt;
&lt;I LOCHINVAR&gt;
O, young Lochinvar is come out of the west,
Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
And save his good broadsword he weapons had none,
He rode all unarm'd, and he rode all alone.
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
He staid not for brake, and he stopp'd not for stone,
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,
The bride had consented, the gallant came late:
For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
So boldly he enter'd the Netherby Hall,
Among bride's-men. and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,
(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)
'O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?'
'I long woo'd your daughter, my suit you denied:-
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide -
And now am I come, with this lost love of mine,
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
&lt;P 143&gt;
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.'
The bride kiss'd the goblet: the knight took it up,
He quaff'd off the wine, and he threw down the cup.
She look'd down to blush, and she look'd up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.
He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,-
'Now tread we a measure]' said young Lochinvar.
So stately his form, and so lovely her face,
That never a hall such a galliard did grace;
While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
And the bride-maidens whisper'd, 'Twere better by far,
To have match'd our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.'
One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,
When they reach'd the hall-door, and the charger stood near;
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,
So light to the saddle before her he sprung]
'She is won] we are gone, over blank, bush, and scaur;
They'll have fleet steeds that follow,' quoth young Lochinvar.
There was mounting 'mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;
Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran:
There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,
But the lost bride of Netherby ne'er did they see.
So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,
Have ye e'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?-

&lt;P 146&gt;
&lt;V XX&gt;
At night, in secret, there they came,
The Palmer and the holy Dame.
The moon among the clouds rose high,
And all the city hum was by.
Upon the street, where late before
Did din of war and warriors roar,
 You might have heard a pebble fall,
A beetle hum, a cricket sing,
An owlet flap his boding wing
 On Gile's steeple tall.
The antique buildings, climbing high,
Whose Gothic frontlets sought the sky,
 Were here wrapt deep in shade;
There on their brows the moonbeam broke,
Through the faint wreaths of silvery smoke,
 And on the casements play'd.
 And other light was none to see,
   Save torches gliding far,
 Before some chieftain of degree,
 Who left the royal revelry
   To bowne him for the war.
A solemn scene the Abbess chose,
A solemn hour, her secret to disclose.

&lt;V XXI&gt;
'O holy Palmer]' she began,
'For sure he must be the sainted man,
Whose blessed feet have trod the ground
Where the Redeemer's tomb is found,
For His dear Church's sake, my tale
Attend, nor deem of light avail,
Though I must speak of worldly love,
How vain to those who wed above]
De Wilton and Lord Marmion woo'd
Clara de Clare, of Gloster's blood -
(Idle it were of Whitby's dame,
To say of that same blood I came);
And once, when jealous rage was high,
Lord Marmion said despiteously
Wilton was traitor in his heart,
And had made league with Martin Swart
When he came here on Simnel's part,
And only cowardice did restrain
His rebel aid on Stokefield's plain,-
And dwown he threw his glove:-the thing
Was tired, as wont, before the King;
Where frankly did De Wilton own,
That Swart in Gueldres he had known;
And that between them then there went
Some scroll of courteous compliment.
For this he to his castle sent;
But when his messenger return'd,
Judge how de Wilton's fury burn'd]
For in his packet there was laid
Letters that claim'd disloyal aid,
And proved King Henry's cause betray'd.
His fame, thus blighted, in the field
He strove to clear, by spear and shield;-
To clear his fame in vain he strove,
For wondrous are His ways above]
Perchance some form was unobserv'd;
Perchance in prayer, or faith, he swerv'd;
Else how could guiltness champion quail,
Or how the blessed ordeal fail?

&lt;P 150&gt;
&lt;V XXXI&gt;
The Abbess, seeing strife was vain,
Assumed her wonted state again -
 For much of state she had -
Compos'd her veil, and rais'd her head,
And 'Bid,' in solemn voice she said,
  'Thy master, nold and bad,
The records of his house turn o'er,
 And, when he shall there written see,
  That one of his own ancestry
  Drove the Monks forth of Coventry,
Bid him his fate explore]
Prancing in pride of earthly trust,
  His charger hurl'd him to the dust,
  And, by a base plebeian thrust,
He died his band before.
  God judge 'twixt Marmion and me;
  He is a Chief of high degree,
And I a poor recluse:
  Yet oft, in holy writ, we see
  Even such weak minister as me
May the oppressor bruise:
  For thus, inspir'd, did Judith slay
   The mighty in his sin,
  And Jael thus, and Deborah' -
   Here hasty Blount broke in:
'Fitz-Eustace, we must march our band:
Saint Anton' fire thee] wilt thou stand
All day, with bonnet in thy hand,
  To hear the Lady preach?
By this good light] if thus we stay,
Lord Marmion, for our fond delay,
  Will sharper sermon teach.
Come, don thy cap, and mount thy horse;
The Dame must patience take perforce.'

&lt;V XXXII&gt;
'Submit we then to force,' said Clare,
'But let this barbarous lord despair
  His purpos'd aim to win;
Let him take living, land, and life;
But to be Marmion's wedded wife
  In me were deadly sin:
And if it be the King's decree,
That I must find no sanctuary,
In that inviolable dome,
Where even a homicide might come,
  And safely rest his head,
Though as its open portals stood,
Thirsting to pour forth blood for blood,
  The kinsmen of the dead;
Yet one asylum is my own
  Against the dreaded hour;
A low, a silent, and a lone,
  Where the Kings have little power.
&lt;P 151&gt;
One victim is before there.-
Mother, your blessing, and in prayer
Remember your unhappy Clare]'
Loud weeps the Abbess, and bestows
  Kind blessings many a one :
Weeping and wailing loud arose,
Round patient Clare, the clamorous woes
  Of every simple nun.
His eyes the gentle Eustace dried,
And scarce rude Blount the sight could bide.
  Then took the squire her rein,
And gently led away her steed,
And, by each courteous word and deed,
  To cheer her strove in vain.

&lt;H Introduction to Canto Sixth&gt;
&lt;V VII&gt;
 All nations have their omens drear,
Their legends wild of woe and fear.
To Cambria look-the peasant see
Bethink him of Glendowerdy,
And shun 'the spirit's Blasted Tree.'
The Highlander, whose red claymore
The battle turn'd on Maida's shore,
Will, on a Friday morn, look pale,
Id ask'd to tell a fairy tale:
He fears the vengeful Elfin King,
Who leaves that day his grassy ring:
Invisible to human ken,
He walks among the sons of men.

&lt;V VIII&gt;
 Did'st e'er, dear Heber, pass along
Beneath the towers of Franchemont,
Which, like an eagle's nest in air,
Hang o'er the stream and hamlet fair?
Deep in their vaults, the peasants say,
A mighty treasure buried lay,
Amass'd through rapine and through wrong
By the last Lord of Franchemont.
The iron chest is bolted hard,
A huntsman sits, its constant guard;
Around his neck his horn is hung,
His hanger in his belt is slung;
Before his feet his blood-hounds lie;
An 'twere not for his gloomy eye,
Whose withering glance no heart can brook,
As true a huntsman doth he look
As bugle e'er in brake did sound,
Or ever hollow'd to a hound.
To chase the fiend, and win the prize,
In that same dungeon ever tries
An aged necromantic priest;
It is an hundred years at least,
Since 'twixt them first the strife begun,
And neither yet has lost nor won.
And oft the Conjurer's words will make
The stubborn Demon groan and quake;
And oft the bands of iron break,
Or bursts one lock, that still amain,
Fast as 'tis open'd, shuts again.
That magic strife within the tomb
May last until the day of doom,
Unless the adept shall learn to tell
The very word that clench'd the spell,
When Franch'mont lock'd the treasure cell.
An hundred years are pass'd and gone,
And scarce three letters has he won.

&lt;V IX&gt;
 Such general superstition may
Excuse for old Pitscottie say;
Whose gossip history has given
My song the messenger from Heaven,
That warn'd, in Lithgow, Scotland's King,
Nor less the infernal summoning;
May pass the Monk of Durham's tale,
Whose demon fought in Gothic mail;
May pardon plead for Fordun grave,
Who told of Gifford's Goblin-Cave.
But why such instances to you,
Who, in an instant, can renew
Your treasured hoards of various lore,
And furnish twenty thousand more?
Hoards, not like theirs whose volumes rest
Like treasures in the Franch'mont chest,
While gripple owners still refuse
To others what they cannot use;
Give them the priest's whole century,
They shall not spell you letters three;
Their pleasure in the books the same
The magpie takes in pilfer gem.
Thy volumes, open as thy heart,
Delight, amusement, science, art,
To every ear and eye impart;
Yet who of all who thus employ them,
Can like the owner's selk enjoy them?-
But, hark] I hear the distant drum]
The day of Flodden Field is come.-
Adieu, dear Heber] life and health,
And store of literary wealth.

&lt;H The Battle&gt;
&lt;V VIII&gt;
'A word of vulgar augury,
That broke from me, I scarce knew why,
 Brought on a village tale;
Which wrought upon his moody sprite,
And sent him armed forth by night.
 I borrow'd steed and mail,
And weapons, from his sleeping band;
 And, passing from a postern door,
We met, and 'counter'd hand to hand,-
 He fell on Gifford moor.
For the death-stroke my brand I drew,
(O then my helmed head he knew,
  The Palmer's cowl was gone,)
Then had three inches of my blade
The heavy debt of vengeance paid;
My hand the thought of Austin staid;
 I left him there alone.
O good old man] even from the grave
Thy spirit could thy master save:
If I had slain my foeman, ne'er
Had Whitby's Abbess, in her fear,
Given to my hand this packet dear,
Of power to clear my injured fame,
And vindicate De Wilton's name.
Perchance you heard the Abbess tell
Of the strange pageantry of Hell,
  That broke our secret speech -
It rose from the infernal shade,
Or featly was some juggle play'd,
 A tale of peace to teach.
Appeal to Heaven I judged was best,
When my name came among the rest.

&lt;V IX&gt;
'Now here, within Tantallon Hold,
To Douglas late my tale I told,
To whom my house was known of old.
Won by my proofs, his falchion bright
This eve anew shall dub me knight.
These were the arms that once did turn
The tide of fight on Otterburne,
And Harry Hotspur forced to yield,
When the dead Douglas won the field.
These Angus gave-his armour's care,
Ere morn shall every breach repair;
For nought, he said, was in his halls,
But ancient armour on the walls,
And aged chargers in the stalls,
And women, priests, and grey-hair'd men,
The rest were all in Twisel glen.
And now I watch my armour here,
By law of arms, till midnight's near;
Then, once again a belted knight,
Seek Surrey's camp with dawn of light.

&lt;V X&gt;
'There soon again we meet, my Clare]
This Baron means to guide thee there:
Douglas reveres his King's command,
Else would he take thee from his band.
And there thy kinsman, Surrey, too,
Will give De Wilton justice due.
Now meeter far for martial broil,
Firmer my limbs, and strung by toil,
Once more'-'O Wilton] must we then
Risk new-found happiness again,
  Trust fate of arms once more?
And is there not an humble glen,
  Where we, content and poor,
Might build a cottage in the shade,
A shepherd thou, and I to aid
  Thy task on dale and moor?
That reddening brow]-too well I know,
Not even thy Clare can peace bestow,
  While falsehood stains thy name:
Go then to fight] Clare bids thee go]
Clare can a warrior's feelings know,
  And weep a warrior's shame,
Can Red Earl Gilbert's spirit feel,
Buckle the spurs upon thy heel,
And belt thee with thy brand of steel,
And send thee forth to fame]'

&lt;P 162&gt;
&lt;V XIX&gt;
Even so it was.  From Flodden ridge
  The Scots beheld the English host
  Leave Barmore-wood, their evening post,
  And heedful watch'd them as they cross'd
The Till by Twisel Bridge.
  High sight it is, and Haughty, while
  They dive into the deep defile;
  Beneath the cavern'd cliff they fall,
  Beneath the castle's airy wall;
By rock, by oak, by hawthorn-tree,
  Troop after troop are disappearing;
  Troop after troop their banners rearing,
Upon the eastern bank you see;
Still pouring down the rocky den,
  Where flows the sullen Till,
And rising from the dim-wood glen,
Standards on standards, men on men,
  In slow succession still,
And, sweeping o'er the Gothic arch,
And pressing on, in ceaseless march,
  To gain the opposing hill.
That morn, to many a trumpet clang,
Twisel] thy rock's deep echo rang;
And many a chief of birth and rank,
Saint Helen] at thy fountain drank.
Thy hawthorn glade, which now we see
In spring-tide bloom so lavishly,
Had then from many an axe its doom,
To give the marching columns room.

&lt;V XX&gt;
And why stands Scotland idly now,
Dark Flodden] on the airy brow,
Since England gains the pass the while,
And struggles through the deep defile?
What checks the fiery soul of James?
Why sits that champion of the dames
  Inactive on his steed,
And sees, between him and his land,
Between him and Tweed's southern strand,
  His host Lord Surrey lead?
What 'vails the vain knight-errant's brand?
O, Douglas, for thy leading wand]
  Fierce Randolph, for thy speed]
O for one hour of Wallace wight,
Or well-skill'd Bruce, to rule the fight,
And cry 'Saint Andrew and our right]'
Another sight had seen that morn,
From Fate's dark book a leaf been torn,
And Flodden had been Bannockbourne]
The precious hour has pass'd in vain,
And England's host has gain'd the plain;
Wheeling their march, and circling still,
Around the base of Flodden hill.

&lt;P 166&gt;
&lt;V XXIX&gt;
When, doff'd his casque, he felt free air,
Around 'gan Marmion wildly stare:-
'Where's Harry Blount? Fitz-Eustace where?
Linger ye here, ye hearts of hare]
Redeem my pennon, -charge again]
Cry 'Marmion to the rescue]' -Vain]
Last of my race, on battle-plain
That shout shall ne'er be heard again]
Yet my last thought is England's; fly,
  To Dacre bear my signet-ring:
  Tell him his squadrons up to bring.
Fitz-Eustace, to Lord Surrey hie;
  Tunstall lies dead upon the field,
  His life-blood stains the spotless shield:
  Edmund is down: -my life is reft;
  The Admiral alone is left.
  Let Stanley charge with spur of fire,-
  With Chester charge, and Lancashire,
  Full upon Scotland's central host,
  Or victory and England's lost.
  Must I bid twice?-hence, varlets] fly]
  Leave Marmion here alone-to die.'
  They parted, and alone he lay;
  Clare drew her from the sight away,
Till pain wrung forth a lowly moan,
And half he murmur'd, 'Is there none,
  Of all my halls have nurst,
Page, squire, or groom, one cup to bring
Of blessed water from the spring,
  To slake my dying thirst]'

&lt;V XXX&gt;
O Woman] in one hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,
And variable as the shade
By the light quivering aspen made;
When pain and anguish wring the brow,
A ministering angel thou]
Scarce were the piteous accents said,
When, with the Baron's casque, the maid
  To the nigh streamlet ran:
Forgot were hatred, wrongs, and fears;
The plaintive voice alone she hears,
  Sees but the dying man.
She stoop'd her by the runnel's side,
  But in abhorrence backward drew;
For, oozing from the mountain's side,
Where raged the war, a dark-red tide
  Was curdling in the streamlet blue.
Where shall she turn?-behold her mark
  A little fountain cell,
Where water, clear as diamond-spark,
  In a stone basin fell.
Above, some half-worn letters say,
Drink.weary.pilgrim.and.pray.
for.the.kind.soul.of.Sybil.Grey.
  Who.built.this.cross.and.well.
&lt;P 167&gt;
She fill'd the helm, and back she hied,
And with surprise and joy espied
  A monk supporting Marmion's head:
A pious man, whom duty brought
To dubious verge of battle fought,
  To shrieve the dying, bless the dead.

&lt;P 170&gt;

Why then a final note prolong,
Or lengthen out a closing song,
Unless to bid the gentles speed,
Who long have listed to my rede?
To Statesmen grave, if such may deign
To read the Minstrel's idle strain,
Sound head, clean hand, and piercing wit,
And patriotic heart-as PITT]
A garland for the hero's crest,
And twin'd by her he loves the best;
To every lovely lady bright,
What can I wish but faithful knight?
To every faithful lover too,
What can I wish but lady true?
And knowledge to the studious sage;
And pillow to the head of age.
To thee, dear schoolboy, whom my lay
Has cheated of thy hour of play,
Light task, and merry holiday]
To all, to each, a fair good-night,
And pleasing dreams, and slumbers light]

&lt;V1&gt;
To mute and to material things
New life revolving summer brings;
The genial call dead Nature hears,
And in her glory reappears.
But oh, my Country's wintry state
What second spring shall renovate?
What powerful call shall bid arise
The buried warlike and the wise;
The mind that though for Britain's weal,
The hand that grasp'd the victor steel?
The vernal sun new life bestows
Even on the meanest flower that blows;
But vainly, vainly may he shine
Where glory weeps o'er Nelson's shrine;
And vainly pierce the solemn gloom
That shrouds, O Pitt, thy hallow'd tomb]
&lt;V2&gt;
Deep graved in every British heart,
O never let those names depart]
Say to your sons, - Lo, here his grave,
Who victor died on Gadite wave]
To him, as to the burning levin,
Short, bright, resistless course was given.
Where'er his country's foes were found
Was heard the fated thunder's sound,
Till burst the bolt on yonder shore,
Roll'd, blazed, destroy'd - and was no more.
&lt;V3&gt;
Nor mourn ye less his perish'd worth,
Who bade the conqueror go forth,
And launch'd that thunderbolt of war
On Egypt, Hafnia, Trafalgar;
Who, born to guide such high emprise,
For Britain's weal was early wise;
Alas] to whom the Almighty gave,
For Britain's sins, an early grave]
 - His worth, who is his mightiest hour
A bauble held the pride of power,
Spurn'd at the sordid lust of pelf,
And served his Albion for herself;
Who, when the frantic crowd amain
Strain'd at subjection's bursting rein,
O'er their wild mood full conquest gain'd,
The pride he would not crush, restrain'd,
Show'd their fierce zeal a worthier cause,
And brought the freeman's arm to aid the freeman's laws
&lt;V4&gt;
Hadst thou but lived, though stripp'd of power,
A watchman on the lonely tower,
Thy thrilling trump had roused the land,
When fraud or danger were at hand;
By thee, as by the beacon-light,
Our pilots had kept course aright;
As some proud column, though alone,
Thy strength had propp'd the tottering throne.
Now is the stately column broke,
The beacon-light is quench'd in smoke,
The trumpet's silver voice is still,
The warder silent on the hill]
&lt;V5&gt;
O think, how to his latest day,
When Death, just hovering, claim's his prey,
With Palinure's unalter'd mood
Firm at his dangerous post he stood;
Each call for needful rest repell'd,
With dying hand the rudder held,
Till in his fall with fateful sway
The steerage of the realm gave way.
Then - while on Britain's thousand plains
One unpolluted church remains,
Whose peaceful bells ne'er sent around
The bloody tocsin's maddening sound,
But still upon the hallow'd day
Convoke the swains to praise and pray;
While faith and civil peace are dear,
Grace this cold marble with a tear:-
He who preserved them, Pitt, lies here]
&lt;V6&gt;
Nor yet suppress the generous sigh,
Because his rival slumbers nigh;
Nor be thy Requiescat dumb
Lest it be said o'er Fox's tomb.
For talents mourn, untimely lost,
When best employ'd, and wanted most;
Mourn genius high, and lore profound,
And wit that loved to play, not wound;
And all the reasoning powers divine
To penetrate, resolve, combine;
And feelings keen, and fancy's glow -
They sleep with him who sleeps below:
And, if thou mourn'st they could not save
From error him who owns this grave,
Be every harsher thought suppress'd,
And scared be the last long rest.
Here, where the end of earthly things
Lays heroes, patriots, bards, and kings;
Where stiff the hand, and still the tongue,
Of those who fought, and spoke, and sung;
Here, where the fretted vaults prolong
The distant notes of holy song,
As if some angel spoke agen,
'All peace on earth, good-will to men';
If ever from an English heart,
O, here let prejudice depart,
And, partial feeling cast aside,
Record that Fox a Briton died]
When Europe crouch'd to France's yoke,
And Austria bent, and Prussia broke,
And the firm Russian's purpose brave
Was barter'd by a timorous slave -
Even then dishonour's peace he spurn'd,
The sullied olive-branch return'd,
Stood for his country's glory fast,
And nail'd her colours to the mast]
Heaven, to reward his firmness, gave
A portion in this honour'd grave;
And ne'er held marble in its trust
Of two such wondrous men the dust.
&lt;V7&gt;
With more than mortal powers endow'd,
How high they soar'd above the crowd]
Theirs was no common party race,
Jostling by dark intrigue for place;
Like fabled gods, their mighty war
Shook realms and nations in its jar;
Beneath each banner proud to stand,
Look'd up the noblest of the land,
Till through the British world were known
The names of Pitt and Fox alone.
Spells of such force no wizard grave
E'er framed in dark Thessalian cave,
Though his could drain the ocean dry,
And force the planets from the sky.
These spells are spent, and spent with these
The wine of life is on the lees.
Genius, and taste, and talent gone,
For ever tomb'd beneath the stone,
Where - taming thought to human pride] -
The mighty chiefs sleep side by side.
Drop upon Fox's grave the tear,
'Twill trickle to his rival's bier;
O'er Pitt's the mournful requiem sound,
And Fox's shall the notes rebound.
The solemn echo seems to cry,
'Here let their discord with them die.
Speak not for those a separate doom
Whom fate made Brothers in the tomb;
But search the land of living men,
Where wilt thou find their like agen?'


&lt;T OH SAY NOT, MY LOVE&gt;
&lt;D 1810?&gt;
&lt;P 715&gt;
Oh say not, my love, with that mortified air,
That your spring-time of pleasure is flown,
Nor bid me to maids that are younger repair
For those raptures that still are thine own.

Though April his temples may wreathe with the vine,
Its tendrils in infancy curl'd,
'Tis the ardour of August matures us the wine,
Whose lifeblood enlivens the world.

Though thy form, that was fashion'd as light as a fay's,
Has assumed a proportion more round,
And thy glance, that was bright as a falcon's at gaze,
Looks soberly now on the ground;

Enough, after absence to meet me again,
Thy steps still with ecstasy move;
Enough, that those dear sober glances retain
For me the kind language of love.

O Brignal banks are wild and fair,
And Greta woods are green,
And you may gather garlands there
Would grace a summer queen.
&lt;P 338&gt;
And as I rode by Dalton-hall,
Beneath the turrets high,
A Maiden on the castle wall
Was singing merrily,-
'O, Brignal banks are fresh and fair,
And Greta woods are green;
I'd rather rove with Edmund there,
Than reign our English queen.'

'If, maiden, thou wouldst wend with me,
To leave both tower and town,
Thou first must guess what life lead we,
That dwell by dale and down.
And if thou canst that riddle read,
As read full well you may,
Then to the green-wood shalt thou speed,
As blithe as Queen of May.'
Yet sung she, 'Brignal banks are fair,
And Greta woods are green;
I'd rather rove with Edmund there,
Than reign our English queen.

&lt;VXVII&gt;
I read you by your bugle-horn,
And by your palfray good,
I read you for a ranger sworn
To keep the king's greenwood.'
'A ranger, lady, winds his horn,
And 'tis at peep of light;
His blast is heard at merry morn,
And mine at dead of night.'
Yet sung she, 'Brignal banks are fair,
And Greta woods are gay;
I would I were with Edmund there,
To reign his Queen of May]

With burnish'd brand and musketoon
So gallantly you come,
I read you for a bold dragoon,
That lists the tuck of drum.'
'I list no more the tuck of drum,
No more the trumpet hear;
But when the beetle sounds his hum,
My comrades take the spear.

'And O] though Brignal banks be fair,
And Greta woods be gay,
Yet mickle must the maiden dare,
Would reign my Queen of May]
&lt;V XVIII&gt;
Maiden] a nameless life I lead,
A nameless death I'll die;
The fiend whose lantern lights the mead,
Were better mate than I]
And when I'm with my comrades met
Beneath the greenwood bough,
What once we were we all forget,
Nor think what we are now.
Yet Brignal banks are fresh and fair,
And Greta woods are green,
And you may gather garlands there
Would grace a summer queen.'

No more of me you knew,

No more of me you knew.

'This morn is merry June, I trow,
The rose is budding fain;
But she shall bloom in winter snow,
Ere we two meet again.'
He turn'd his charger as he spake,
Upon the river shore,

Said 'Adieu for evermore,

And adieu for evermore.'

&lt;T SAINT CLOUD&gt;
&lt;D 1815&gt;
&lt;P 724&gt;
Softspread the southern summer night
Her veil of darksome blue;
Ten thousand stars combined to light
The terrace of Saint Cloud.

The evening breezes gently sigh'd,
Like breath of lover true,
Bewailing the deserted pride
And wreck of sweet Saint Cloud.

The drum's deep roll was heard afar,
The bugle wildly blew
Good-night to Hulan and Hussar,
That garrison Saint Cloud.

The startled Naiads from the shade
With broken urns withdrew,
And silenced was that proud cascade,
The glory of Saint Cloud.

We sate upon its steps of stone,
Nor could its silence rue,
When waked, to music of our own,
The echoes of Saint Cloud.

Slow Seine might hear each lovely note
Fall light as summer dew,
While through the moonless air they float,
Prolong'd from fair Saint Cloud.

And sure a melody more sweet
His waters never knew,
Though music's self was wont to meet
With Princes at Saint Cloud.

Nor then, with more delighted ear,
The circle round her drew,
Than ours, when gather'd round to hear
Our songstress at Saint Cloud.

Few happy hours poor mortals pass, -
Then give those hours their due,
And rank among the foremost class
Our evenings at Saint Cloud.

&lt;T WANDERING WILLIE&gt;
&lt;D 1806&gt;
&lt;P 707&gt;
All joy was bereft me that day that you left me,
And climb'd the tall vessel to sail yon wide sea;
O weary betide it] I wander'd beside it.
And bann'd it for parting my Willie and me.

Far o'er the wave hast thou follow'd thy fortune,
Oft fought the squadrons of France and of Spain,
Ae kiss of welcome's worth twenty at parting,
Now I hae gotten my Willie again.

When the sky it was mirk, and the winds they were wailing,
I sat on the beach wi' the tear in my ee,
And thought o' the bark where my Willie was sailing,
And wish'd that the tempest could a' blaw on me.

Now that thy gallant ship rides at her mooring,
Now that my wanderer's in safety at hame,
Music to me were the wildest winds' roaring,
That e'er o'er Inch-Keith drove the dark ocean faem.

When the lights they did blaze, and the guns they did rattle,
And blithe was each heart for the great victory,
In secret I wept for the dangers of battle,
And thy glory itself was scarce comfort to me.

But now shalt thou tell, while I eagerly listen,
Of each bold adventure, and every brave scar;
And trust me, I'll smile, though my een they may glisten;
For sweet after danger's the tale of the war.

And oh, how we doubt when there's distance 'tween lovers,
When there's naething to speak to the heart thro' the ee;

&lt;P 708&gt;
How often the kindest and warmest prove rovers,
And the love of the faithfullest ebbs like the sea.

Till, at times - could I help it? I pined and I ponder'd,
If love could change notes like the bird on the tree;
Now I'll ne'er ask if thine eyes may hae wander'd,
Enough, thy leal heart has been constant to me.

Welcome, from sweeping o'er sea and through channel,
Hardships and danger despising for fame,
Furnishing story for glory's bright annal,
Welcome, my wanderer, to Jeanie and hame]

Enough, now thy story in annals of glory
Has humbled the pride of France,
Holland, and Spain;
No more shalt thou grieve me, no more shalt thou leave me,
I never will part with my Willie again.

&lt;T WILLIAM AND HELEN&gt;
&lt;D 1795&gt;
&lt;P 630&gt;
From heavy dreams fair Helen rose,
And eyed the dawning red:
'Alas, my love, thou tarriest long]
O art thou false or dead?'

With gallant Fred'rick's princely power
He sought the bold Crusade;
But not a word from Judah's wars
Told Helen how he sped.

With Paynim and with Saracen
At length a truce was made,
And every knight return'd to dry
The tears his love had shed.

Our gallant host was homeward bound
With many a song of joy;
Green waved the laurel in each plume,
The badge of victory.

And old and young, and sire and son,
To meet them crowd the way,
With shouts, and mirth, and melody,
The debt of love to pay.

Full many a maid her true-love met,
And sobb'd in his embrace,
And flutt'ring joy in tears and smiles
Array'd full many a face.

Nor joy nor smile for Helen sad;
She sought the host in vain;
For none could tell her William's fate,
If faithless, or if slain.

The martial band is past and gone;
She rends her raven hair,
And in distraction's bitter mood
She weeps with wild despair.

'O rise, my child,' her mother said,
'Nor sorrow thus in vain;
A perjured lover's fleeting heart
No tears recall again.'

'O mother, what is gone, is gone,
What's lost for ever lorn:
Death, death alone can comfort me;
O had I ne'er been born]

'O break, my heart - O break at once]
Drink my life-blood, Despair]
No joy remains on earth for me,
For me in heaven no share.'

'O enter not in judgement, Lord]'
The pious mother prays;
'Impute not guilt to thy frail child]
She knows not what she says.

&lt;P 631&gt;
'O say thy pater noster, child]
O turn to God and grace]
His will, that turn'd thy bliss to bale,
Can change thy bale to bliss.'

'O mother, mother, what is bliss?
O mother, what is bale?
My William's love was heaven on earth,
Without it earth is hell.

'Why should I pray to ruthless Heaven,
Since my loved William's slain?
I only pray'd for William's sake,
And all my prayers were vain.'

'O take the sacrament, my child,
And check these tears that flow;
By resignation's humble prayer,
O hallow'd be thy woe]'

''No sacrament can quench this fire,
Or slake this scorching pain;
No sacrament can bid the dead
Arise and live again.

'O break, my heart - O break at once]
Be thou my god, Despair]
Heaven's heaviest blow has fallen on me,
An vain each fruitless prayer.'

'O enter not in judgement, Lord,
With thy frail child of clay]
She knows not what her tongue has spoke;
Impute it not, I pray]

'Forbear, my child, this desperate woe,
And turn to God and grace;
Well can devotion's heavenly glow
Convert thy bale to bliss.'

'O mother, mother, what is bliss?
O mother, what is bale?
Without my William what were heaven,
Or with him what were hell?'

Wild she arraigns the eternal doom,
Upbraids each sacred power,
Till, spent, she sought her silent room,
All in the lonely tower.

She beat her breast, she wrung her hands,
Till sun and day were o'er,
And through the glimmering lattice shone
The twinkling of the star.

Then, crash] the heavy drawbridge fell
That o'er the moat was hung;
And, clatter] clatter] on its boards
The hoof of courser rung.

The clank of echoing steel was heard
As off the rider bounded;
And slowly on the winding stair
A heavy footstep sounded.

And hark] and hark] a knock-tap] tap]
A rustling stifled noise;
Door-latch and tinkling staples ring;
At length a whispering voice:

'Awake, awake, arise, my love]
How, Helen, dost thou fare?
Wak'st thou, or sleep'st? laugh'st thou, or weep'st?
Hast thought on me, my fair?'

'My love] my love] - so late by night]
I waked, I wept for thee:
Much have I borne since dawn of morn;
Where, William, couldst thou be?'

'We saddle late - from Hungary
I rode since darkness fell;
And to its bourne we both return
Before the matin-bell.'

'O rest this night within my arms,
And warm thee in their fold]
Chill howls through hawthorn bush the wind:
My love is deadly cold.'

&lt;P 632&gt;
'Let the wind howl through hawthorn bush]
This night we must away;
The steed is wight, the spur is bright;
I cannot stay till day.

'Busk, busk, and boune] thou mount'st behind
Upon my black barb steed:
O'er stock and stile, a hundred miles,
We haste to bridal bed.'

'To-night - to-night a hundred miles?
O dearest William, stay]
The bell strikes twelve - dark, dismal hour]
O wait, my love, till day]'

'Look here, look here - the moon shines clear -
Full fast I ween we ride;
Mount and away] for ere the day
We reach our bridal bed.

'The black barb snorts, the bridle rings;
Haste, busk, and boune, and seat thee]
The feast is made, the chamber spread,
The bridal guests await thee.'

Strong love prevail'd.  She busks, she bounes,
She mounts the barb behind,
And round her darling William's waist
Her lily arms she twined.

And, hurry] hurry] off they rode,
As fast as fast might be;
Spurn'd from the courser's thundering heels
The flashing pebbles flee.

And on the right, and on the left,
Ere they could snatch a view,
Fast, fast each mountain, mead, and plain,
And cot, and castle flew.

'Sit fast - dost fear? The moon shines clear;
Fleet goes my barb - keep hold]
Fear'st thou?' 'O no]' she faintly said;
'But why so stern and cold?

'What yonder rings? what yonder sings?
Why shrieks the owlet grey?'
' 'Tis death-bells' clang, 'tis funeral song,
The body to the clay.

'With song and clang, at morrow's dawn,
Ye may inter the dead:
To-night I ride, with my young bride,
To deck our bridal bed.

'Come with thy choir, thou coffin'd guest,
To swell our nuptial song]
Come, priest, to bless our marriage feast]
Come all, come all along]'

Ceased clang and song; down sunk the bier;
The shrouded corpse arose:
And, hurry] hurry] all the train
The thundering steed pursues.

And, forward] forward] on they go;
High snorts the straining steed;
Thick pants the rider's labouring breath,
As headlong on they speed.

'O William, why this savage haste?
And where they bridal bed?'
' 'Tis distant far, low, damp, and chill,
And narrow, trustless maid.''

'No room for me?' 'Enough for both;
Speed, speed, my barb, thy course]'
O'er thundering bridge, through boiling surge
He drove the furious horse.

&lt;P 633&gt;
Tramp] tramp] along the land they rode,
Splash] splash] along the sea;
The scourge is wight, the spur is bright,
The flashing pebbles flee.

Fled past on right and left how fast
Each forest, grove, and bower]
On right and left fled past how fast
Each city, town, and tower]

'Dost fear? dost fear? The moon shines clear,
Dost fear to ride with me?
Hurrah] hurrah] the dead can ride]'
'O William, let them be]

'See there, see there] What yonder swings,
And creaks' mid whistling rain?'
'Gibbet and steel, th' accursed wheel;
A murderer in his chain.

'Hollo] thou felon, follow here:
To bridal bed we ride;
And thou shalt prance a fetter dance
Before me and my bride.'

And, hurry] hurry] clash] clash] clash]
The wasted form descends;
And fleet as wind through hazel bush
The wild career attends.

Tramp] tramp] along the land they rode,
Splash] splash] along the sea;
The scourge is red, the spur drops blood,
The flashing pebbles flee.

How fled what moonshine faintly show'd]
How fled what darkness hid]
How fled the earth beneath their feet,
The heaven above their head]

'Dost fear? dost fear? The moon shines clear,
And well the dead can ride;
Does faithful Helen fear for them?'
'O leave in peace the dead]'

'Barb] barb] methinks I hear the cock;
The sand will soon be run:
Barb] barb] I smell the morning air;
The race is wellnigh done.'

Tramp] tramp] along the land they rode,
Splash] splash] along the sea;
The scourge is red, the spur drops blood,
The flashing pebbles flee.

'Hurrah] hurrah] well ride the dead;
The bride, the bride is come;
And soon we reach the bridal bed,
For, helen, here's my home.'

Reluctant on its rusty hinge
Revolved an iron door,
And by the pale moon's setting beam
Were seen a church and tower.

With many a shriek and cry, whiz round
The birds of midnight, scared;
And rustling like autumnal leaves
Unhallow'd ghosts were heard.

O'er many a tomb and tombstone pale
He spurr'd the fiery horse,
Till sudden at an open grave
He check'd the wondrous course.

The falling gauntlet quits the rein,
Down drops the casque of steel,
The cuirass leaves his shrinking side,
The spur his gory heel.

The eyes desert the naked skull,
The mould'ring flesh the bone,
Till Helen's lily arms entwine
A ghastly skeleton.

&lt;P 634&gt;
The furious barb snorts fire and foam,
And, with a fearful bound,
Dissolves at once in empty air,
And leaves her on the ground.

Half seen by fits, by fits half heard,
Pale spectres flit along,
Wheel round the main in dismal dance,
And howl the funeral song;

'E'en when the heart's with anguish cleft,
Revere the doom of Heaven]
Her soul is from her body reft:
Her spirit be forgiven]'
