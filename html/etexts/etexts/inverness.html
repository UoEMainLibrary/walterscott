		<h3>Inverness, engraved by W. Miller after J.M.W. Turner (1836).</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From: <em>The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> Vol. 26 (Edinburgh:
	  Cadell, 1836). </p>
		<p>A royal burgh since the 12th century and a city since the year 2000, Inverness
		  has long been considered the capital of the Highlands. Following the
		  Jacobite Uprising of 1715, its castle was greatly enlarged by General
		  Wade, and a substantial garrison quartered there as a means of pacifying
		  the Highlands. The town was captured by the Jacobites in 1746, who
		   after their defeat a Culloden, destroyed most of the Castle by laying
		  mines under it. The massive military complex of Fort George was subsequently
		  built just outside Inverness.</p>
