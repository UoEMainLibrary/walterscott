		<h3>Linlithgow, engraved by W. Miller after J.M.W. Turner (1836).</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From: <em>The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> Vol. 25 (Edinburgh:
	  Cadell, 1836). </p>
		<p>The burgh of Linlithgow, situated between Edinburgh and Stirling, was founded
		  in the mid-12th century by King David I. In the early 15th century
		  James I began converting its castle into a palace which remained a
		  favourite royal residence for centuries. Mary Queen of Scots was born
		  in Linlithgow Palace in 1542. Its last royal resident was Prince
		  Charles Edward Stuart ('Bonnie Prince Charlie'). In
		  January 1746
		  the Palace was burned out by the Duke of Cumberland's army, and remains
		  a ruin.</p>
