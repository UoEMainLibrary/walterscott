		<h3>Dunstaffnage Castle, engraved by W. Miller after J.M.W. Turner (1836).</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From: <em>The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.</em> Vol. 24 (Edinburgh:
	  Cadell, 1836). </p>
		<p>Dunstaffnage, to the north of Oban, was an important strategic site as early
		  as the 7th century when  the Kings of Dalriada, the Kingdom
            of the Scots who migrated to Argyll from Ireland, built a stronghold
            there. Most of the surviving castle was built in the 13th century
		  by the Macdougalls, Lords of the Isles. It was captured
		  by Robert the Bruce in 1309 and passed to the Earls of Argyll in 1470.
		  The castle was burned in 1685 during an attempted uprising by
          the Earl of Argyll against James II and VII. During the Jacobite uprising
		  of 1746-46, Flora
          MacDonald was imprisoned here after assisting Prince Charles Edward
		  Stuart ('Bonnie Prince Charlie') to escape. <br>
