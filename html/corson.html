                 C. Corson</a>, librarian, scholar, and Scottophile, and now

            <p>James Clarkson Corson was born in Edinburgh on 30 June 1905. He 
              was educated at Daniel Stewart's College, 1911-1924, before entering 
              Edinburgh University to read history, in which he graduated on 28 
              June 1928. Corson stayed on at Edinburgh University for a further 
              six years, obtaining the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1934 
              for his thesis on 'The English Revolution and the Doctrines of Resistance 
              and Non-Resistance, 1688-1714: A Study in Sovereignty'</p>

            <p>Before he completed his postgraduate work, however, Corson had
               taken up a post in the <a href="http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/">University
                Library</a>. At first he was employed as an Assistant Librarian,
                 but he soon rose to the position of Deputy Librarian in 1939,
                where 
              he was to remain until his retirement in 1965. Corson served as
                 a Deputy to Lauriston Sharp, who, like Corson, was an Edinburgh
                
              graduate; Sharp had joined the Library staff a few years before
                 Corson in the mid-1920s, first as Assistant Librarian, moving
                on 
              to become Keeper of Manuscripts in 1931. Sharp and Corson served
                 their apprenticeships as academic librarians during the era
                of F.C. 
              Nicholson, very much a scholar-librarian of the sort which is now
                 but a memory. In this atmosphere, the two apprentices were able
                
              to undertake serious scholarly pursuits, Sharp editing the <i>Early
               Letters of Robert Wodrow</i> for the Scottish History Society,
              with the help of Corson who 'corrected such proofs as I have given
              him
              with meticulous accuracy, and has given me the benefit of his expert
              knowledge of the art of indexing', a skill which would later be
               used for the benefit of Scott scholars. Corson assisted Sharp
               in presiding over the Library during the difficult years of the
              war, and during the less difficult years of the 1950s, during which
              time Sharp was giving serious consideration to the problems of
              accommodation
              in Old College and to the preliminary stages of planning the construction
              of what is now the Main Library building in George Square. Corson
              had to look after the Library for a year following the sudden death
              of his old friend. When E. R. S. Fifoot was eventually appointed
              as Sharp's successor, Corson retired.<br>

          <td align="left" valign="top" colspan="2" height="1306"> James Clarkson 
            Corson first became infatuated with Walter Scott in 1917 as a result 
            of reading <em><a href="works/poetry/lady.html">The Lady of the Lake</a></em> 
            as a set text in his English class at school, and he devoured all 
            the Waverley Novels whilst still in his teens. He visited <a href="biography/homes.html">Abbotsford</a> 
            for the first time in 1919, an experience which he later described 
            as a 'milestone', and which started the infatuation with that building 
            which was to last the rest of his life. He started to collect seriously 
            from the Centenary of Scott's death in 1932 onwards, when he began 
            to amass posters, programmes, and newspaper cuttings. The first major 
            public sign of his devotion to Scott appeared in 1943 with the publication 
            of his <em>A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott: A Classified and Annotated 
            List of Books and Articles Relating to his Life and Works 1797-1940</em>. 
            A major contribution to literary bibliography of the time, this work 
            can still be used with profit (and caution) alongside Todd and Bowden's 
            magisterial Scott bibliography. 
            <p>During the 1950's Corson was able to find the time to publish a 
              considerable amount of bibliographical and historiographical work 
              on Scott. Two articles on <em>The Border Antiquities</em> appeared 
              in the early issues of the new journal of Scottish bibliography, 
              <em>The Bibliotheck</em> (1956 and 1960), which were then followed 
              by two articles in the same journal on materials found in the Library 
              at Abbotsford, namely <em>Chapbooks</em> (1960) and <em>American 
              books</em> (1963). In 1955 Corson delivered the Walter Scott Lectures 
              in the University, on the state of 'Scott Studies', published as 
              two articles in the <em>University of Edinburgh Journal</em>, vol.18 
              (1955-57), in which he both surveyed the long history of scholarship 
              on Scott, and took the opportunity to correct some biographical 
              errors about the life of Scott. The final summation of Corson's 
              scholarly life was of course his <em>Notes and Index to Sir Herbert 
              Grierson's Edition of the Letters of Sir Walter Scott</em> (Oxford, 
              1979), in which he displayed both his deep knowledge of Scott's 
              life and works, and his network of correspondence, but also his 
              aptitude for indexing, first hinted at by Sharp in the 1930s.</p>
            <p>Corson's obsession with Scott did not only manifest itself in his 
              writings on the man. Corson also devoted much of his life to amassing 
              a huge collection of materials by and about Scott, a collection 
              quite unique in both its breadth and depth.</p>
            <p>The collection can be divided into five categories: printed books, 
              manuscripts, press cuttings, visual materials (prints, drawings 
              and paintings), and realia. </p>
            <p>The printed books themselves formed Corson's basic reference library; 
              it was built up patiently throughout his adult life: he himself 
              regarded it as containing 'practically every work &#133; that the 
              student of Scott is likely to want to consult'. The books number 
              some 6,000 printed editions, mostly editions of Scott's works, including 
              a sampling of first editions, but consisting in the main of later 
              editions, particularly strong on the popular editions of the later 
              19th and early 20th century, mostly British, but with some American 
              and European editions and translations. Among the highlights of 
              this portion of the Corson Collection are a presentation copy from 
              Scott to Anna Seward of <em>The Chase</em> (1796), Charles Kirkpatrick 
              Sharpe's copy of the first edition of <em><a href="works/novels/waverley.html">Waverley</a></em> 
              (1814), the Duke of Wellington's copy of <em><a href="file:///J|/SPECOLL/newWalterScott/works/novels/well.html">St 
              Ronan's Well</a> </em>(1824), and an early proof of <a href="works/poetry/lady.html"><em>The 
              Lady of the Lake</em></a>. </p>
            <p>Works about Scott also feature prominently, especially biographical 
              and critical studies, with numerous editions of Lockhart's <i>Life 
              of Sir Walter Scott</i>. This category of materials also includes 
              a large number of musical scores, playbills, and theatre programmes 
              which have a connection with Scott, no matter how tenuous. Finally, 
              there are a large number of books from the 18th century onwards 
              concerning the Scottish Borders and other parts of Scotland and 
              England associated with Scott. The printed books have all been catalogued 
              into the <a href="http://catalogue.lib.ed.ac.uk/">Edinburgh University 
              Library online catalogue</a>.</p>
            <p>The manuscript material is less comprehensive in its coverage, 
              but includes a number of literary manuscripts such as the handwritten 
              text of the only sermon Scott ever wrote, and a number of Scott 
              letters. The main portion of the manuscripts, however, contains 
              a large and rather eclectic array of letters by Scott scholars and 
              others after his death, but referring in some way to Scott and his 
              works.</p>
            <p>The press cuttings contain references to Scott in the Scottish 
              and UK press from the Centenary of Scott's death in 1932 to the 
              late 1980's. They constitute an invaluable record of the presence 
              of Scott in the national consciousness throughout the twentieth-century 
              and would be of great interest to any scholar researching Scott's 
              role in the the formation of national identity.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the whole collection is the 
              section devoted to illustrative material. This term covers a multitude 
              of visual formats, mostly unbound, and consisting of works of art 
              on paper, but also including 25 oil paintings by artists such as 
              David Roberts, Robert Scott Lauder, and Sir William Allan (his painting 
              of the 'Fair Maid of Perth' was recently loaned to the City Arts 
              Centre, Edinburgh, for their exhibition 'William Allan: Artist Adventurer' 
              and also appears in their catalogue by Jeremy Howard). The bulk 
              of the illustrative material, however, is to be found in the collection 
              of ca. 10,000 engravings, etchings, lithographs, photographs, and 
              drawings, including original drawings by artists such as James Skene 
              of Rubislaw (recently loaned to the National Galleries of Scotland 
              exhibition 'O Caledonia'), and David Octavius Hill (last loaned 
              to the Scottish Arts Council touring exhibition on Hill and Adamson 
              curated by Katherine Michaelson). </p>
            <p>The <a href="realia.html">realia</a> in the collection are where 
              Corson's obsession with Scott took hold in its most astonishing 
              form, including not only miniature bed-warming pans, but toy soldiers, 
              shortbread tins, tea towels, and other examples of material culture 
              associated with Scott. The material is undoubtedly of serious interest 
              to the researcher interested not only in Scott, but in material 
              culture and national identity.</p>
			<p>Both the realia and the illustrative material are currently being entered in an <a href="imdata.html">Image Database</a> which supplies an image and description of each item.</p>
            <p>Finally, mention should be made of Corson's most significant contribution 
              to his own collection: an index which he referred to as his 'Scott 
              Dictionary', some 200,000 cards containing notes on every aspect 
              of Scott's life and works begun in 1935 and maintained up until 
              his death in 1988. </p>
            <p>The collection was sold by Corson to the University under an agreement 
              in 1978, and it was transferred to the University Library in Edinburgh 
              in 1989. After his death, Corson's widow generously bequeathed a 
              sizeable estate to the University to maintain and develop the collection.</p>
