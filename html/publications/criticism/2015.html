            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  essay revisits Scott&rsquo;s theory of 'the force of&hellip;narrative' and argues that the  elaborate paratexts of his early Waverley novels (<a href="../../works/novels/waverley.html"><em>Waverley</em></a>, <a href="../../works/novels/mannering.html"><em>Guy Mannering</em></a>, <a href="../../works/novels/antiquary.html"><em>The Antiquary</em></a>) constitute an expression of  (and experiment in) that theory. In his early Waverley novels and book review  essays, Scott joined his contemporaries in grappling with the demise of classical  rhetoric, elaborating a theory of narrative force by rethinking the two  dominant Romantic conceptions of force: military force and rhetorical force.  This essay thus reveals some overlooked origins of Scott&rsquo;s innovative form of  historical fiction and his theory of the novel.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As  material text and artistic work, <em><a href="../../works/novels/robroy.html">Castle Dangerous</a></em> includes multiple archives.  Ian Duncan reads the barbaric historical episode of the 'Douglas larder',  recalled by two characters in Scott's main narrative, as an 'anti-archive'  representing the collapse of romance, chivalric ideals, and indeed all human  cultural values into an abject midden-heap. Both his declining health and his fears  of the impending Reform Bill influence Scott's pessimism. Expanding his version  of the larder episode, however, Scott's fictional minstrel Bertram describes an  alternative space--the 'study' or library. Surviving Douglas's burning of the  castle, the library sustains multiple minstrel/archivists, from a ghostly  Thomas the Rhymer to Scott himself as still-adept imaginative architect.  Although the larder represents Derrida's 'anti-archive' as thanatos, the  library salvages a positive archive, a source of eros to re-energise and shape  the future --but only by acknowledging this tension. Within the contrasting  erotic plots of his main narrative, Scott introduces a further archive: ongoing  refigurings of William Wallace. Through it, he critiques chivalric romances and  their codes, yet recasts them to imagine an accommodation for conservatives  within a post-Reform electorate. </font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  article opens by surveying Scott's work as an editor of literature, historical  documents, and memoirs between 1802 and 1815. It argues that he was the first  to recognise that in transmission texts deteriorate, but that his main aim in  editing was to prevent loss, both of the texts and the memory of them. It  demonstrates that he deploys the knowledge gleaned from editing in the notes to  the long poems, but argues that his greatest achievement was in naturalising  this learning in the speech of characters in his 'Scotch' novels. It contends  that the change in artistic methodology was prompted by his experience of  editing memoirs, and by his own experiments in life-writing. It concludes by  suggesting that Scott was actuated by the extraordinary ambition of unifying  knowledge within the autonomous work of art, and of harmonising all that is  known within his oeuvre.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modern editions of Scott's narrative poems often omit his  notes, which frequently extend well beyond straightforward elucidation to seem  embarrassingly prolix or obscurely antiquarian. However, unlike the notes to  his novels, the notes to Scott's poems were present from first publication.  Their function for the early nineteenth-century reader is discussed with  relation to Scott's first long narrative poem, <a href="../../works/poetry/minstrel.html"><em>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</em></a>,  where their treatment of the supernatural is compared with that of the verse itself.  With Scott, tropes of translation, scholarship, and antiquarianism serve to  widen access to the uncanny and remind readers that even in the most  enlightened age the human imagination responds powerfully to extra-rational  explanation. Scott's notes are a vital part of his poems.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Editing   <a href="../../works/poetry/minstrelsy.html"><em>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</em></a>, Scott sought  to salvage and preserve the cultural memory of the Border region.  As much was brought to his attention through his extensive network of  contributors as was gleaned from his own antiquarian study and capacious  memory. This paper examines the role of Scott's friendships with Robert  Shortreed of Jedburgh (1762-1829) and William Laidlaw of Yarrow (1779-1845). Although the two men are largely unacknowledged within the  <em>Minstrelsy</em> itself, both Shortreed and Laidlaw provided Scott with significant  assistance before and after the publication of the first edition. While  Shortreed introduced Scott to the remote corners of Roxburghshire during the  so-called 'Liddesdale Raids' of the 1790s, Laidlaw was a prolific  collector of ballads in Selkirkshire during the early 1800s. The memoirs of the  two men, combined with extant correspondence and historical evidence concerning  the families, provide fascinating insights into the social networks of the area  as well as the cultural contexts surrounding the <em>Minstrelsy</em>'s creation. This paper  examines what the Shortreed and Laidlaw families can reveal about Border life  at the turn of the nineteenth century, and assesses the place of the <em>Minstrelsy</em>  ballads in the contemporary cultural memory of the region.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By  exploring case studies from the United Kingdom, this article investigates how  the notions of aura and authenticity associated with literary homes are  utilised to create an impact on the understanding of the lives and works of  associated writers. The boundaries of the article are dictated by its  place within 21st- century manifestations of the survival, conservation  and reproduction of literary homes associated with four writers active in the  early 19th century: Byron,Keats, Scott and Shelley. Many of the works within the literary house genre highlight the  significance of the link between writers and their audiences. However, whereas  commentators represent the links as direct, this article shows that the  association is based on narratives validated through those who were  subsequently responsible for the houses in conjunction with the expectations of  visitors. Consequently, the interpretation prevalent in the houses in the  21st century are the result of a long history based on the writers, but  influenced by what was, and is, considered their significance by others over  approximately 200 years.</font></p>

Scott's ecological approach to cultural memory, as  expressed both in his fictions (particularly <a href="../../works/novels/antiquary.html"><em>The Antiquary</em></a>) and in his activities, explains his long-lasting  influence on material culture and on practices of commemoration.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  essay explores Walter Scott&rsquo;s theories of dialogue, and in particular his  comparisons of fictional speech to the art of painting. It argues that in  prefatory material to both <em><a href="../../works/novels/lammermoor.html">The Bride of Lammermoor</a></em> and <em><a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html">Ivanhoe</a></em>, Scott draws on  contemporary theories of painting to explain his use of dialogue, but the texts  contradict each other in an important way: while the former underscores the  stark contrast between the arts, the latter insists upon their similarities. I  argue that this inconsistency is Scott&rsquo;s attempt to present a multi-front  vindication of the novel in which dialogue represents both the traditional  techniques and innovative possibilities of the form, its simultaneous distance  from and proximity to more ancient and critically appreciated arts.</font></p>

              <p class="style1"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This chapter explores how Scott's condemned women serve as relics through which a history of evolving British  legal authority becomes present and legible. It argues that Scott's treatment  of gender aestheticizes a particular concept of and reaction to the condemned  woman in the context of the common law tradition generally. Using the backdrop  of 18th-century penal practice, it also shows how Scott establishes the  female condemned body as an object necessarily fixed in time in order to contemplate  legal change through a historically controlled process. The first part of the  article considers the late 18th-century movement to abolish the  punishment of burning at the stake for women convicted of treason, and the  extent to which competing understandings of chivalry reified an entire history  of penal practice into the body of the burned woman. The second part argues  that the interrelations between archaic practice and evolved norm which  characterize the precedent-based common law system are dramatized in the fixed,  idealized bodies of Constance de Beverly (<a href="../../works/poetry/marmion.html"><em>Marmion</em></a>) and Rebecca (<a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html"><em>Ivanhoe</em></a>) through which  Scott acknowledges the implicit need for legal change over time, while  simultaneously legitimizing adherence to a chivalric tradition.

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scott has a spectral presence in the early Victorian fiction of R. S. Surtees  (1805-1865) that has hithertoo gone unnoticed. R. S. Surtees was best known as a  sportsman, magazine editor (<em>The Sporting Life</em>), and author of comic novels that  were notable for their satirical subplots of love and marriage. Rather like  Scott, he has fallen from favour with readers, and the frequent references to  the Waverley Novels by Surtees seem to be equally unremarked. Shepherd argues  that this is another example of what Ann Rigney might describe as a cultural  'afterlife' of Walter Scott and one that deserves greater scrutiny. Surtees'  focus on the pleasures and perils of fox hunting parallels Scott's depictions  of the chase as an arena within which he could explore matters of deceit,  conflict and negotiations interest</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scott acknowledged that he was unable to create believable female  characters, unlike Austen and Ferrier. However, in the 1830s, the popular  English poet, Letitia Landon, who was an avid enthusiast for Scott's work, wrote  a series of essays, 'The Female Portrait Gallery', each devoted to  analysing the heroine of a novel by Scott,. Landon does not criticise Scott's creations in her essays, but from a twenty-first-century  perspective, one has to agree with Scott's own opinion of his female  characters; his young women are idealised abstractions and the older ones  caricatures. But where a heroine is based on a real person, such as Alice Lee  in <a href="../../works/novels/cavalier.html"><em>Woodstock</em></a> (who was probably inspired by his own daughter) such a female  character, while still an unattainable archetype, seems somewhat more lifelikeerest in the</font></p>
