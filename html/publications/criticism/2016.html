In celebrating Bannatyne, the Club engages in self-conscious  practices of myth-making that illuminate the members&rsquo; sense of their own  relationship to the past, and of the Club&rsquo;s function in endorsing a distinctive  Scottish identity in the context of political union. Analysis of a collection of papers compiled by club member, James Nairne, offers  evidence of the complex intersection of personal and scholarly motivations at  work, and of the significance of the past in  shaping personal and collective identities.</font></p>

Within the context of problematised or absent  depictions of maternity, and fraught anxieties surrounding the authority of and  the ability to narrate narratives textually, this article explores how the  connection between these two discourses raises further tensions. The article  opens by drawing from scholarly work on the role of writing and orality, and  the presentation of maternity and gender, to explore how the two are connected.  By developing current scholarship in this area, and by offering close textual  readings of <em><a href="../../works/novels/waverley.html">Waverley</a>, <a href="../../works/novels/mannering.html">Guy Mannering</a></em> and <em><a href="../../works/novels/monastery.html">The Monastery</a></em>, this article  concludes that whilst orality may be connected to females more generally,  writing is the domain of women who fulfil Romantic ideologies of maternity.

He believed that an income tax would give the  nation&rsquo;s elites an opportunity to acknowledge their duties and contribute their  fair share toward the payment of the national war debt, thus stabilizing the  economy and eliminating a crucial motive for reform legislation. <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> reimagines this  solution by translating the nation&rsquo;s relationship to government debt into a  system of personal indebtedness. </font></p>

              <p align="left" class="style1"><font size="2"> How  can we relate the quantitative presence of literary artifacts to their ability  to make a difference, and how does the problem of scale define public accounts  of what can be considered relevant literary value? The idea of a singular space  of reception (one literary 'marketplace', say, or one 'public sphere') is  unhelpful. Rather, literary artifacts have potentially multiple social lives  that differ in their relation to 'sacralized' and 'everyday' practices. An  aesthetic object can thrive in many simultaneous or successive practice spaces  that use and value it differently and that embed it in differing sites of  authority. Moving from the Romantic period to the present, this article looks  at the trajectories of Walter Scott as an earlier and Toni Morrison as a recent  candidate for culturally relevant authors.</font></p>

Walter  Scott, however, daily was exceeding the span allotted to many a contemporary  writer and challenging both discourses. Now, verging toward death, he set out  on a journey around the Mediterranean in search of health. At 61, and reduced  to ordinariness by the sufferings of age, the author focused inward, studying  the mysteries of his failing mind. Scott thus mapped an undiscovered country,  demonstrating what it could mean if Romanticism&rsquo;s practitioners could ever  venture through maturity and beyond.</font></p>

These three writers, albeit to different degrees and in different ways, saw Charles's pertinence to then-current debates against revolution, that is to say, to advocacy of counter-revolution at the time of or in the shadow of the French Revolution. Specifically this essay focuses initially on Burke&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>&nbsp;which shaped the framework of much conservative thinking from 1790. Thereafter the essay considers affinities between Burke&rsquo;s text (and his text&rsquo;s divergences from) non-fiction and fiction by the politically conservative Jane Austen and Walter Scott. The focus is on two pre-eminent myths authored or authorised by the monarch himself which endured into and beyond the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: Charles as the Royal Martyr and Charles as Christ (and, hence, as intercessor for his people).</font></p>

The latter, and in particular Washington  Irving and James Fenimore Cooper, used the notion of chivalry to portray Native  Americans in their fictions. However, the degenerate turn that they impart to  medieval trappings, as they transfer them onto the New World wilderness, is  loaded with the political concerns of the Early Republic, recasting this  British imprint as a thing of the past, bound to fade away in the face of more  modern values. American heroes are now fit to take over, as this relic of the  Old Europe is placed in an irrecoverable past.</font></p>

Partly prompted by his suspicions of  working-class radicalism during his novel-writing period (1814&ndash;32),  Scott developed a novelistic celebration of truly &lsquo;aristocratic&rsquo; cloth&mdash;fine  linen&mdash;and used it to represent the finest qualities he associated with the  nation whose bard he had hoped he had become. Not surprisingly, the choice of  linen as a commodity reflects as well an implicit denigration (and thus  suspicion) of the mass-produced commodity par excellence, cotton, because of  its association with working-class radicalism.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Since  the latter part of the19th century, critics have tended to treat Walter  Scott&rsquo;s fiction disparagingly &ndash; the tacit assumption often being that it lacks  formal sophistication or semantic &lsquo;depth.&rsquo; Reading Scott against the grain of  this reception, this article argues that <em><a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html">Ivanhoe</a></em> commands an allusive density which complicates such verdicts.  Offering a detailed analysis of both the novel&rsquo;s hermit figure and the cultural  geography in which it appears, this essay retraces Scott&rsquo;s references to 18th-century  literary, aesthetic, architectural, and horticultural discourses. Acutely aware  of drawing from a codified set of readily consumable images, Scott both quotes  and subverts the eighteenth-century hermit tradition. Employing an elaborately intertextual  strategy to defamiliarize readerly notions of identity and signification,  Scott&rsquo;s writing emerges as somewhat more complex than the history of his  critical reception would seem to suggest.</font></p>
