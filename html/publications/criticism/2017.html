              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  essay explores the contemporary reception of  the first adaptation of a Walter Scott <a href="../../works/novels/mannering.html">novel</a> for the stage, Daniel Terry's <em>Guy Mannering; or, The Gipsey's Prophecy</em> (1816). It shows that many more people, from a much wider socio-economic  background, would have seen Terry's version between 1816 and 1824 than would  have had access to the novel. Reviews of  the play indicate that its popularity was enhanced by Scott's extraordinary  fame and status, and, indeed, it was judged by its closeness to the novel.  Terry's play paved the way for a rush of stage adaptations of Scott's novels,  and presents one of the many spin-offs that Scott's works inspired and enabled.  The play, in turn, contributed to shaping the reception of the most popular  novelist of the early nineteenth century.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This essay traces apparent contradictions in the improvisatory authorship of <em><a href="../../works/poetry/minstrel.html">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</a></em>.  Scott, it argues, seeks to dramatize in a modern printed poem anchored by  historical notes the spontaneous and occasional remit of traditional minstrelsy. The story itself,  moreover, turns on actions that are notionally unforeseen (<em>improvisus</em>) for an uninitiated  reader of romantic ballads. Seemingly  from memory, Scott, through his surrogate compositional  voices, refashions a range of poetic and scholarly materials  from a common stock and from the corpora of others, including, controversially,  an as-then unpublished but widely recited fragment by Coleridge. By masterfully  reining in his plot by the closing of the text, Scott asserts his authorial control over the poem  as it exists on the page and yet still maintains in a kind of living archive  the open-ended nature of improvised minstrelsy.</font></p>

This  article examines allegories and analyses of speculation in texts by Byron, John  Galt, Walter Scott (<a href="../../works/novels/redgaun.html"><em>Redgauntlet</em></a>), and Willibald Alexis, together with the Poyais scandal, a  notorious example of real-world financial speculation. Combining fact and  fiction, these rapidly written texts are early examples of &lsquo;speculative  fiction&rsquo; that illustrate the dynamics of speculation as a self-perpetuating  performance that is sustained by belief and vulnerable to contingency.<br>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  article considers the interrelations of temporality and spatiality in the early  nineteenth century. Comparing Scott's journal of his tour of the lighthouses of  Great Britain and his fictional revisiting of the islands of Orkney and Shetland in <em><a href="../../works/novels/pirate.html">The Pirate</a></em>, it looks at two  different historical contexts: the (supposed) post-war summer of 1814 and the imperial expansion  of the 1820s. It explores the ways Scott  uses the rarely visited Northern Islands to think about other spaces: war-torn Europe and the archipelagic empire. Setting  the diary form against the novel, Fielding then thinks about the form of the novel as  genre in literary history, the progress of the national  tale, and finally the uses of georgic as metonymic of literature as a  whole fiction. </font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style1">This  article argues that Scott&rsquo;s conceptualisation of <em><a href="../../works/poetry/minstrel.html">The Lay of the Last  Minstrel</a></em>  as 'being &lsquo;in a light-horseman sort of stanza'  is  metonymic of the interspecific force dynamics that he evokes in representing  relations with non-human animals in the poem. Integrating force dynamics into  the ecocritical agenda can serve as a means to move beyond anthropocentrism, as  well as the binarised assumption that there exists an environmental  intrinsicality, by shifting the focus of attention to relational interfaces.  Resistance to or exertion of physical force is, in many instances of Scott&rsquo;s  work, an instantiation of hierarchicalised relationships between human and  non-human animals or categories of the human. Analysis of the light-horseman  trope frames the examination of force dynamics in the representation of a  horse, a dog and birds in <em>The Lay</em>. </span></font></p>

The first part of the article employs Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek's concept of  the &lsquo;vanishing mediator&rsquo; to help clarify the White Lady's structural function as an agent of historical change.  Gottlieb then turns to Bruno Latour's  socio-anthropological theories to help reframe the novel's more wide-ranging  representations of historical conflict. By re-describing <em>The Monastery</em> via Latour's recent  rhetoric of &lsquo;modes of existence&rsquo;, each with  its own set of truth-conditions, trajectories, and subject-effects, the article aims to  illuminate not only the novel<em>'</em>s historical stakes but also its ongoing relevance for us in the early  twenty-first century, as we continue to negotiate a variety of seemingly  mutually incomprehensible forces and belief systems.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20th-century  literary scholarship traditionally viewed Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novels as central  in popularizing a cogent, British ideology of nationalism. Instead, Scott&rsquo;s oeuvre reveals how Scottishness is  essential to&mdash;and not elided in&mdash;the project of Great Britain. The problematic  'unified' vision of a British nation-state and imagined community relies on the  myth of Westphalian sovereignty, which, resulting from the 1648 Treaty of  Westphalia, posits that a state&rsquo;s power is limited only by geographic borders.  However, Scott&rsquo;s <em><a href="../../works/novels/talisman.html">The Talisman</a></em> anachronistically imposes the nation-state  model on a Crusaders&rsquo; camp in 12th-century Palestine; the camp&rsquo;s porous  borders exacerbate what Freud terms the 'narcissism of minor differences'  between European nations. <em>The Talisman</em> reveals the failure of  ideological fantasies like the nation-state and Westphalian sovereignty:  because characters like Saladin and the Scottish Sir Kenneth transgress  borders, <em>The Talisman</em> reveals that nation-states succeed only by  initiating exchanges with their global and local peripheries. </font></p>

Although  explicit discussion of <em>Ossian</em> in <em>The Antiquary</em> is mainly confined to  Jonathan Oldbuck's comic dialogue with his hot-headed Highland nephew Hector  MacIntyre in volume I, chapter 3, the essay argues that the debate was actually  central to the larger issue of the ethnic origins and modern identity of the Scots, dramatized in the  arguments between the &lsquo;Gothic&rsquo; Oldbuck and the &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo; Sir  Arthur Wardour throughout the novel. Oldbuck's planned epic <em>The Caledoniad</em> is discussed in  relation to Macpherson's epic <em>Fingal</em>, and I  conclude with a suggestion that the often-criticized &lsquo;invasion plot&rsquo; of <em>The Antiquary</em> might have been  inspired by that of <em>Fingal</em>, and  also Macpherson's earlier poem <em>The Highlander</em>.  Scott's irenic vision of Britain in <em>The Antiquary</em> thus resolves ethnic conflict between Goths and Celts in the interest of national unity.</font></p>

It argues that they draw attention to broader thematic concerns about politics and power. Ultimately, Scott's  engagement with the supernatural allows him to explore the possibilities of language and the limitations of  poetic form. Interest in the supernatural also positions him in dialogue with  Romantic contemporaries including Samuel Taylor Coleridge and John Keats, as well as  situating his poetry within a gothic Romantic aesthetic.</font></p>

Each depicts a journey from Scotland to England in search of justice at the monarch&rsquo;s hand and, inseparably from that, the establishing of a secure domestic space &ndash; the creation of a home &ndash; that emblematises the concept of successfully co-existent English and Scottish cultural identities.&nbsp;<em>The Fortunes of Nigel</em>, set in the reign of James I, considers the factors&ndash;personal, political, theological and social&ndash; contributing to the overthrow of Charles I&rsquo;s sovereignty and the establishment of the Interregnum.&nbsp;<em>The Heart of Mid-Lothian</em>&nbsp;considers questions of rebellion and societal injustice within the framework of Hanoverian dynastic rule over Britain. In the context of political upheaval, what is of particular interest is  the exploration of  the continuum between home and nation in the two novels: the experiences of an insecure domestic space and of an unstable national identity by members of two different social classes, in two different historical periods, under two different yet sequent monarchies.</font></p>

As Oelsner points out, it has been commonly accepted   by historians of Danish romanticism that the Jutland heath only became a   motif in Danish romantic art following an influential lecture by Niels   Laurits H&oslash;yen (1798-1870) at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in   Copenhagen, in March 1844. However, Oelsner reveals that the early   sketches and diaries of the Danish landscape painter Martinus R&oslash;rbye   (1803-1848) make it clear that he went to then largely unknown Jutland   as early as 1830, and was shortly followed by other artists &ndash; all   influenced significantly by the work of Scott.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This essay investigates Walter Scott's writing, across  several genres, as a contribution to an environmental historiography of Scotland. It investigates whether that writing  provides any evidence for an early land ethic that anticipates Aldo Leopold's  20th-century use of that term. It also discusses Scott's response to aesthetic discourses of his  time via an exploration of ballads, poetry, fiction and a  range of non-fiction documents that  includes letters, a statement to parliament and minute books. It further considers Scott's  involvement in oil gas production and his concern about the depletion of river salmon stocks due  to modern methods of fishing aimed  at exploiting stocks to meet product demand from London. The essay is set in a  framework of contextualized historical sources, as well as recent developments  in ecocriticism and the environmental humanities.</font></p>

For  Fuseli, paintings ought to select pregnant moments for representation, moments  from which whole narrative sequences can be intuited. Implicit in this notion  is the belief that some moments are particularly suited to representation  because they are qualitatively different from others&mdash;more fully narrative,  because more indicative of larger processes of change. Turning to Scott&rsquo;s  novel, Poot shows how this assumption features prominently in <em>The Bride of Lammermoor</em>, where it  repeatedly produces unforeseen, calamitous consequences.</font> </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  post-French Revolution debate in  Britain saw a battle over the meaning and political uses of the gothic, in which the historical novel of the English Civil War and the  Commonwealth became an important site. Its pages restaged, in generic as well  as political terms, the conflict between, on the one hand, radicals and dissenters, and, on the other, Church and King. While radical writers deployed the  gothic to evoke the horrors of oppression, both Cassandra  Cooke's <em>Battleridge</em> (1799) and Jane West's <em>The Loyalists</em> (1812) positioned the  radicals as themselves the terrorized source of terror. In the process they  reclaimed medicinal and scientific authority for the royalists, a position that William Godwin problematizes in <em>Mandeville</em> (1817). Tracing the  complexities of this debate, this article that Walter Scott's <em><a href="../../works/novels/cavalier.html">Woodstock</a></em> replies to both sides in  a metafictional <em>tour de force</em>. Reading Scott's  novel against these earlier historical fictions, it becomes evident that the  novel is a bitter expos&eacute; of the battle over gothic as anything but rational.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This essay reassesses Scott's &lsquo;handing down&rsquo; strategy in a  Romantic context, from his &lsquo;multi-handed&rsquo; authorial  technique and his staging of the transmission process into publication, to the role of the  often-intrusive hand of the translator and the question of the variability of the text. The essay begins by exploring  the author's fetishization of the hand motif and the way it  reflects on his own writing practices. Affected from an early age by  chilblains, Scott literally had to rely on helping hands all through his  career. As a writer, his relationship to the hand and the act of writing was therefore  paradoxical. The hand as a motif in Scott's writing is shown to be displaced  from its physical manifestation into the realm of metaphor, and from the literal  to the aesthetic and poetic spheres.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This essay interrogates the striking silences in Scott's <em>oeuvre</em> in relation to Scotland's  involvement as a partner of the British Empire in the colonization of the Caribbean and in the exploitation of slavery in  this region. Drawing from narratological theories (especially those articulated by Robyn R. Warhol and Ruth Rosaler), it treats Scott's  silences as examples of &lsquo;implicature&rsquo; &mdash; a &lsquo;conspicuous silence&rsquo;, which acquires and generates meaning through the  interaction of text and context, and represents a form  of communication in its own right.  Through a discussion of samples from his <em>Letters, <a href="../../works/prose/grandfather.html">Tales of a  Grandfather</a>, <a href="../../works/poetry/rokeby.html">Rokeby</a>, <a href="../../works/novels/robroy.html">Rob Roy</a>, <a href="../../works/novels/antiquary.html">The Antiquary</a></em> and <em><a href="../../works/novels/midlothian.html">Heart of Mid-Lothian</a></em>, Sassi tries to  identify the invisible maps of  meaning of the unsaid and &lsquo;unnarrated&rsquo;. While suggesting that this approach  allows us to articulate a more nuanced perspective on Scott and Scottish-Caribbean relations, it also allows us to critically rethink the problems and  possibilities of engaging with Caribbean slavery in British and other European  nineteenth-century fiction. </font></p>

This essay considers the royal pardon itself, addressing  how Scott distinguishes Effie Dean's trial for infanticide from practices governing both the crime and judicial  protocol, and connecting criminal procedure with national  politics and the royal prerogative itself. Scott emphasizes what is problematic  about the mercy of the Hanoverians, but at the same time demonstrates,  especially in the final chapters of the novel, the necessity and the propriety  of what in <em>The Life of Napoleon</em> he calls &lsquo;this  right of mercy&rsquo; that was &lsquo;wrest[ed] from the crown&rsquo; during the French  Revolution.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Virginia Woolf recognized Walter Scott's considerable influence on literary history, but she  rejected Scott by appealing to a principle of &lsquo;life&rsquo;, a composite of delicate  perception, vivid imagination, and what Woolf described as &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; rather  than &lsquo;materialist&rsquo; writing. This  essay extends Woolf's formulation to include &lsquo;fullness of life&rsquo;, a  non-sectarian designation of spirituality,  and renegotiates her relation to Scott on that basis. It argues that the  spiritual for Scott and Woolf is found less in transcendence (a conventional  feature of spirituality) than in the <em>failure</em> to  reconcile &lsquo;life&rsquo; to &lsquo;fullness&rsquo;, the &lsquo;energies&rsquo; of individuals to the history  that exceeds them. Romance becomes the record, indeed, the very form of this failure. It is this failure,  precisely, that motivates belief &mdash; whether in history (Scott) or in what  surpasses it (Woolf) &mdash; in the first place.</font></p>
