              <p align="left" name="darcy"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><em>Scott's Books</em> aims to provide an approachable introduction to the Waverley Novels. Drawing on substantial research in Scott's intertextual sources, it offers a fresh approach to the existing readings where the thematic and theoretical are the norm. Avoiding jargon, and moving briskly, it tackles the vexed question of Scott's 'circumbendibus' style head on, suggesting that it is actually one of the most exciting aspects of his fiction: indeed, what Ian Duncan has called the 'elaborately literary narrative', at first sight a barrier, is in a sense what the novels are primarily 'about'. The book aims to show how inventive, witty, and entertaining Scott's richly allusive style is; how he keeps his varied readership on board with his own inexhaustible variety; and how he allows proponents of a wide range of positions to have their say, using a detached, ironic, but never cynical narrative voice to undermine the more rigid and inhumane rhetoric.</font></font></p>

                among novelists of the Romantic period, Austen and Scott, have 
                been continuously reprinted, read, and discussed from first publication 
                until the present day. In this study, Bautz traces how Scott&#8217;s 
                nineteenth-century success among all classes of readers made him 
                the most admired and widely read novelist in history, only for 
                his standing to plummet sharply in the twentieth century. Austen&#8217;s 
                popularity, by contrast, has risen inexorably, overtaking Scott&#8217;s, 
                and bringing about a reversal in reputation that would have been 
                unthinkable in the authors&#8217; own time. To assess the reactions 
                of readers belonging to diverse interpretative communities, Bautz 
                draws on a wide range of indicators, including editions, publisher&#8217;s 
                relaunches, sales, reviews, library catalogues and lending figures, 
                private comments in diaries and letters, and popularisations. 
                She charts the reception of each author over two centuries, explaining 
                literary tastes and their determinants, and illuminating the broader 
                culture of successive audiences.</font></blockquote>

              <blockquote><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dawson 
                challenges current views about the correlation between narrative 
                structure, gender, and the governing psychological dilemma in 
                four nineteenth-century British novels. The overarching argument 
                is that the opening situation in a novel represents an implicit 
                challenge facing not the obvious hero/heroine but an individual 
                defined as the 'effective protagonist'. To illustrate his claim, 
                Dawson pairs two sets of novels with unexpectedly comparable dilemmas: 
                <em><a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html">Ivanhoe</a></em> 
                with <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> and <em>Wuthering Heights</em> 
                with <em>Silas Marner</em>. In all four novels, the effective 
                protagonist (in<em> Ivanhoe</em>'s case, Cedric of Rotherwood) 
                is an apparently minor figure whose crucial function in the ordering 
                of the events has been overlooked. Rereading these well-known 
                texts in relation to hitherto neglected characters uncovers startling 
                new issues at their heart and demonstrates innovative ways of 
                exploring both narrative and literary tradition.</font></blockquote>

                is the first comprehensive account of the flowering of Scottish 
                fiction between 1802 and 1832, when Edinburgh rivaled London as 
                a centre for literary and cultural innovation. It situates Scott 
                as the central figure and shows how he helped redefine the novel 
                as the principal modern genre for the representation of national 
                historical life. Duncan traces the rise of a cultural nationalist 
                ideology and the ascendancy of Scott's Waverley novels in the 
                years after Waterloo. He argues that the key to Scott's achievement 
                and influence was the actualization of a realist aesthetic of 
                fiction that offered a socializing model of the imagination as 
                first theorized by Scottish philosopher and historian David Hume. 
                This aesthetic provides a powerful novelistic alternative to the 
                Kantian-Coleridgean account of the imagination that has long been 
                taken as normative for British Romanticism. Duncan goes on to 
                examine how other Scottish writers inspired by Scott's innovations 
                - James Hogg and John Galt in particular - produced in their own

                Waverley novels are increasingly popular in the classroom, fitting 
                into courses that explore topics from Victorianism and nationalism 
                to the rise of the publishing industry and the cult of the author. 
                They present, however, unusual challenges to instructors. Students 
                need guidance, for instance, in navigating Scott's use of vernacular

                references, and distinguishing his multiple authorial personas. 
                The essays in this volume are designed to help teachers negotiate 
                these and other intriguing features of the Waverley novels. Part 
                1, 'Materials', guides instructors in selecting appropriate editions 
                of the Waverley novels for classroom use. It also categorizes

                recommends additional readings for students, as well as multimedia 
                instructional resources. Part 2, 'Approaches', examines the novels' 
                relation to Scottish history, Scott's use of language, and concepts 
                of Romantic authorship; considers gender, legal, queer, and multicultural

              <blockquote><font size="-1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                second chapter of this volume charts the lifelong interest of 
                Sweden's greatest poet Gustaf Fr&ouml;ding (1860-1911) in the 
                novels and poems of Scott. It analyses Fr&ouml;ding's debt to 
                Scott in two of his earliest poetic efforts 'Claverhouse' (inspired 
                by <a href="../../works/novels/mortality.html"><i>Old Mortality</i></a>) 
                and 'Abbotsford' (which grieves for the passing of Romanticism 
                in the person of its 'greatest bard'). Echoes of <a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html"><i>Ivanhoe</i></a>, 
                <a href="../../works/novels/kenilw.html"> <i>Kenilworth</i></a>, 
                and <i><a href="../../works/novels/waverley.html">Waverley</a></i> 
                are traced in later poems, and Scott's view of Scottish history 
                is shown to inform Fr&ouml;ding's own interpretation of the decline 
                of the feudal nobility in Sweden. It is also through Scott that 
                Fr&ouml;ding is introduced to perhaps his greatest influence, 
                Robert Burns. The Scott-related poems are printed in the third 
                chapter with English prose translations.</font></blockquote>

                illustrations for Scott's Waverley novels in Scotland. Consulting 
                numerous neglected primary sources, Richard J. Hill demonstrates

                was actually at the forefront of one of the most innovative publishing 
                and printing trends, the illustrated novel. Hill examines the 
                historical precedents, influences, and innovations behind the 
                creation of the illustrated editions, tracking Scott's personal 
                interaction with the mechanics of the printing and illustration 
                process, as well as Scott's opinions on visual representations 
                of literary scenes. Hill focuses, in particular, on Scott's relationships 
                with William Allan and Alexander Nasmyth, two important early 
                nineteenth-century Scottish artists. As the first illustrators

                of the most lucrative publishing phenomena. <em>Picturing Scotland</em>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style1">Employing gender as a unifying critical focus, Caroline Jackson-Houlston draws on the full range of Walter Scott&rsquo;s novels to propose new links between Scott and Romantic-era authors such as Sophia Lee, Jane Porter, Jane Austen, Sydney Owenson, Elizabeth Hands, Thomas Love Peacock, and Robert Bage. In Scott, Jackson-Houlston suggests, sex and violence are united in a central feature of the genre of romance, the trope of&nbsp;<em>raptus</em>&mdash;the actual or threatened kidnapping of a woman and her subjection to physical or psychic violence. Though largely favouring the Romantic-period drive towards delicacy of subject-matter and expression, Scott also exhibited a residual sympathy for frankness and openness resisted by his publishers, especially towards the end of his career, when he increasingly used the freedoms inherent in romance as a mode of narrative to explore and critique gender assumptions. Thus, while Scott&rsquo;s novels inherit a tradition of chivalric protectiveness towards women, they both exploit and challenge the assumption that a woman is always essentially definable as a potential sexual victim. Moreover, he consistently condemns the aggressive male violence characteristic of older models of the hero, in favour of restraint and domesticity that are not exclusively feminine, but compatible with the Scottish Enlightenment assumptions of his upbringing. A high proportion of Scott&rsquo;s female characters are consistently more rational than their male counterparts, illustrating how he plays conflicting concepts of sexual difference off against one another. Jackson-Houlston illuminates Scott&rsquo;s ambivalent reliance on the attractions of sex and violence, demonstrating how they enable the interrogation of gender convention throughout his fiction</span></font>.</p>

                century; and the dominance of the novel by women writers throughout 
                the 18th century. It argues that both authors, although often 
                seen as quintessentially masculine, use the discourses of the 
                feminine romance or domestic novel to figure authorial control 
                over narrative structure. It suggests that they do so in order

                Scott is identified as a major shaper of the imperial master narrative, 
                helping to generate and sustain English acceptance of an Imperial 
                British identity that is not exclusively English. His 'elite' 
                or 'officer class' perspective is contrasted with the 'subaltern' 
                narratives of James Hogg. Hogg's <em>The Three Perils of Women</em> 
                (1823) is read as a powerful critique of <a href="../../works/novels/waverley.html"><em>Waverley</em></a> 
                challenging Scott's efforts to harness the Highlands to the imperial 
                cause. <em>The Brownie of Bodsbeck</em> (1818) is read as a response 
                to Scott's <em><a href="../../works/novels/mortality.html">Old 
                Mortality</a></em> vindicating the Covenanters from Scott's charge 
                of fanaticism. <em>The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified 
                Sinner</em> (1824) is seen to contain an attack on Scott's antiquarian 
                attitude to rural literature. Satirical versions of Hogg are identified 
                in Scott's own narrative in the figure of Gurth in <a href="../../works/novels/ivanhoe.html"><em>Ivanhoe</em></a> 
                and the Wild Boar of the Ardennes in <a href="../../works/novels/durward.html"><em>Quentin

                there are also readings of John Galt's <em>Ringan Gilhaize</em> 
                (1823) as a riposte to <em>Old Mortality</em> and Stevenson's 
                <em>Kidnapped</em> and <em>Catriona</em> as a reworking and refocussing 
                of the <em>Waverley</em> narrative pattern to portray a recently 
                conquered Highlands exploited by a corrupt government.</font></blockquote>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Walter Scott and Fame</em> is a study of correspondences between Scott   and socially and culturally diverse readers of his work in the   English-speaking world in the early nineteenth century. Examining   authorship, reading, and fame, the book is based on extensive archival   research, especially in the collection of letters to Scott in the   National Library of Scotland. Robert Mayer demonstrates that in Scott's   literary correspondence constructions of authorship, reading strategies,   and versions of fame are posited, even theorized. Scott's   reader-correspondents invest him with power but they also attempt to tap   into or appropriate some of his authority. Scott's version of   authorship sets him apart from important contemporaries like Wordsworth   and Byron, who adhered, at least as Scott viewed the matter, to a   rarefied conception of the writer as someone possessed of extraordinary   power. The idea of the author put in place by Scott in dialogue with his   readers establishes him as a powerful figure who is nevertheless   subject to the will of his audience. Scott's literary correspondence   also demonstrates that the reader can be a very powerful figure and that   we should regard reading not just as the reception of texts but also as   the apprehension of an author-function. Thus, Scott's correspondence   makes it clear that the relationship between authors and readers is a   dynamic, often fraught, connection, which needs to be understood in   terms of the new culture of celebrity that emerged during Scott's   working life. Along with Byron, the study shows, Scott was at the centre   of this transformation.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This book reveals the latent working of the theatre in British   Romantic literature. It shows how two central writers, Wordsworth and   Scott, were fascinated by concepts of theatre that could not be   implemented on the British stage, and how they both addressed and   practised this theatre in their own texts.The book highlights the   importance of the theatre both as a medium and as a discursive field to   address aesthetic, political and epistemic questions around 1800. It   proceeds to explore the unsuccessful implementation of this modern theatre in   early dramas of Wordsworth and Scott and its continuing influence on   their later works. Detailed analyses of Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry and Scott&rsquo;s   novels illustrate how both writers used the genres they chose to develop   a specific form of textual theatre. Finally, the study shows how this   concept of theatre returned to the British stage to influence subsequent periods of   theatre practice. </font></p>

                account of the impact of Scott in Europe, from the early and highly

                Ettrick Forest. Closely connected through kinship and neighbourhood

                as the first real historical novel has led critics to neglect

                volume explores how Scott's work became an all-pervasive point 
                of reference for cultural memory and collective identity in the 
                nineteenth century, and why it no longer has this role. It breaks 
                new ground in memory studies and the study of literary reception 
                by examining the dynamics of cultural memory and the 'social life' 
                of literary texts across several generations and multiple media. 
                Rigney pays attention to the remediation of the Waverley novels 
                as they travelled into painting, the theatre, and material culture, 
                as well as to the role of 'Scott' as a memory site in the public 
                sphere for a century after his death. Using a wide range of examples 
                and supported by many illustrations, she demonstrates how remembering 
                Scott's work helped shape national and transnational identities 
                up to World War One, and contributed to the emergence of the idea 
                of an English-speaking world encompassing Scotland, the British 
                Empire and the United States. Scott's work forged a potent alliance 
                between memory, literature, and identity that was eminently suited 
                to modernization. His legacy continues in the widespread belief 
                that engaging with the past is a condition for transcending it.

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A borderer himself, Walter Scott was well-placed to write about borders from both a concrete/topological and abstract/theoretical perspective. Born in a period of historial transition, and in a Janus-faced city split between its Old and New Towns, he passed his early youth in the Anglo-Scottish Border Country. As pivotal and connective structures, borders are the real heroes of the Waverley Novels. Scott's fictional work is from the outset thematically devoted to movement and particularly 'wandering' or 'wavering' (in the Scots sense). His plots hinge upon border crossings, both physical and symbolic, which constitute initiatory ordeals or rites of passage for the hero. This monograph considers the role of borders in Scott within the context of travel literature devoted to Scott, by writers such as Defoe, Pennant, Johnson, and Boswell, and within the historical framework of the 18th century's cult of travel.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Literary 
                historians have repeatedly observed that while Scott was the first 
                British literary lion of the nineteenth century, his fame as a 
                poet was supplanted by Byron starting in 1812. But that is as 
                far as they take the relationship seriously, for the two writers 
                are traditionally thought of as very different, even as political 
                and temperamental opposites. But in fact, the two writers met 
                each other in 1815, liked each other, and cherished their friendship 
                the rest of their lives. The story of their relationship in personal 
                terms was not over. Nor was the literary relationship, this study 
                ventures. Scott embarked on an entirely new career in 1814, inventing 
                the historical novel. Byron was swept away by the Waverley Novels 
                and in his years of exile to the Continent from 1816 on, repeatedly 
                beseeched his publisher to send Scott&#8217;s latest novels. The 
                position here is that those novels were important to Byron&#8217;s 
                development in both literary and existential respects. Byron&#8217;s 
                historical dramas, his Don Juan, The Island, and his final fling, 
                into the Greek Revolution, show an evolution of both the Byronic 
                Hero and Byron himself in a context his friend Scott had opened 
                up for him. </font></p>

                with particular emphasis on inheritance law, hunting rights, and 
                trial by ordeal. The following section turns to 17th- and 18th-century 
                Scots Law, discussing infanticide (<a href="../../works/novels/midlothian.html"><em>The

                Stechern next analyses the impact of the Union on appellate procedure 
                (<em><a href="../../works/novels/lammermoor.html">The Bride of

                Roy</em></a>, <em>Waverley</em>). The final chapter deals with 
                the development of the office of Justice of the Peace in 18th-century 
                Britain with reference to <em>Rob Roy</em> and <em>Guy Mannering</em>. 
                The conclusion assesses Scott's view of the role of the advocate.</font></blockquote>
