              <p><font size="2">The Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels is 
                the first critical edition of Scott's fiction. It employs the 
                first edition of Scott's novels as the base-text but incorporates 
                manuscript readings lost through accident, error, misunderstanding, 
                or a misguided attempt to improve, as printers struggled to set 
                and print novels at high speed in often difficult circumstances. 
                Each volume contains an essay on the work's genesis, composition, 
                and editorial history, an historical note, a list of emendations, 
                explanatory notes, and a glossary. This edition of Scott's 1820 
                novel <a href="../works/novels/abbot.html"><i>The Abbot</i></a> 
                also draws on the evidence of early American editions based on 
                an uncorrected second proof copy of Scott's text. The 'Historical 
                note' seeks to produce the first coherent account of the family 
                relationships in the novel. </font></p>

                mix of peoples and the fluidity of European boundaries. An unjustly

                of the problems of retrieving and interpreting the historical 
                can be seen as the key to the whole Waverley enterprise. Written 
                in the aftermath of Waterloo, it is concerned with re-establishing 
                the proper transmission of identity and inheritance, making the 
                illegitimate legitimate, and restoring proper relations between 
                past and present. </font></p>

                The historical note explores the novel's setting at the time of 
                the Third Crusade (1189&#8211;92) and shows how the heroine's 
                fate is always determined by the agency of men as both individual 
                claimants and differing cultures (Anglo-Norman and Welsh) strive 
                for mastery over her.<em> <a href="../works/novels/betrothed.html">The 
                Betrothed</a></em> (the first of Scott's <em>Tales of the Crusaders</em>) 
                is presented as a problem novel. Just as Scott was describing 
                the full horrors of medieval arranged marriage, he was himself 
                </font><font size="2">arranging the marriage of his elder son. 
                It is a problem novel too in that it was deeply disliked by Scott's 
                printer and publisher who forced significant changes. What Scott 
                was required to do to meet their objections has been confronted 
                for the first time in this, the first critical edition of the

                to retell a story found in Barbour&#8217;s <em>Brus</em>. During 
                the Scottish Wars of Independence, an English knight for a love 
                wager commits himself to defend Douglas Castle against Scottish 
                attempts to retake it. The ballad-like story embraces intriguing 
                elements including national rivalry, and the idealisation and 
                betrayal of love. The Douglas area, seen as an almost surrealist 
                landscape of ravines, trenches, and tombs forms an appropriate

                For Frank Jordan, <em><a href="../works/novels/nigel.html">The 
                Fortunes of Nigel</a></em> (1822) sits among Walter Scott&#8217;s 
                richest creations in political insight, range of characterisation 
                and linguistic virtuosity. Well versed in the political literature 
                of the period, Scott draws a detailed picture of London in the 
                early 17th century while charting the effects of Scottish influx 
                into the English capital. He masterfully traces a complex web 
                of political and sexual intrigue, and of financial dealings and 
                double-dealing. Steeped in Jacobean drama, this tale shows Scott 
                revelling in the linguistic riches of the age. Previous editions 
                have obscured his stylistic virtuosity, but painstaking examination 
                of the manuscript and proofs allows the full vigour of Scott&#8217;s 
                achievement to be savoured for the first time.</font></p>

                by Garside), reproducing the text of the novel, historical note, 
                explanatory notes, and glossary. A new introduction by Jane Millgate 
                argues that the difficulty of squaring <em><a href="../works/novels/mannering.html">Guy 
                Mannering</a></em> (1815) with a Luk&aacute;csian view of the 
                historical novel has prevented critics from appreciating its originality. 
                The use of two heroes (Mannering and Bertram) is, in many ways, 
                as innovative as <a href="../works/novels/waverley.html"><em>Waverley</em></a> 
                but it was not until the end of the 19th century that novelists 
                like James learned from Scott's complex representation of a middle-aged 
                hero.</font></p>

                The first edition of <em><a href="../works/novels/midlothian.html">The 
                Heart of Mid-Lothian</a></em> (1818) was peculiarly beset by copy-editing 
                errors. Hewitt and Lumsden here attempt to create an 'ideal first 
                edtion', working from Scott's manuscript and rejecting modifications 
                introduced in the seven subsequent editions published in Scott's 
                lifetime. The historical note presents the novel as Scott's only 
                chronicle, spanning the life of David Deans, and charting revolutionary 
                changes in the legal, religious, and cultural life of Scotland. 
                The essay on the novel's genesis disputes Lockhart's account, 
                and suggests that Scott took to heart Thomas McCrie's critique 
                of his treatment of the Covenanters and sought to redress the 
                balance through his portrayal of David and Jeannie Deans. </font></p>

                The historical note argues that <a href="../works/novels/robroy.html"><em>Rob 
                Roy</em></a> is less concerned with the Jacobite Rising than with 
                the economic and political conditions which brought it about, 
                and the remarkable entrepreneurial spirit of the new Hanoverian 
                capitalists which resisted it. It celebrates the freebooting daring 
                of the hero's father in the City of London and, in the figure 
                of the Glasgow merchant Nicol Jarvie, the robust balancing of 
                generosity and selfish calculation which is required in successful 
                enterprise.</font></p>

                This collection of eight pieces of shorter fiction from periodicals 
                extends from a satirical piece appearing in 1811 in <em>The Edinburgh 
                Annual Register</em> through stories from <em>The Sale-Room</em> 
                and <em>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</em> to four stories published 
                late in his life in <em>The Keepsake</em>. Only three of these 
                stories were regularly reprinted. The other five are here made 
                readily available for the first time, and show both Scott's versatility 
                and his continuous exploration of the possibilities of fiction.</font></p>

                <em>The Siege of Malta</em> and 'Bizarro' are Scott's final works, 
                written in Malta and Italy in 1831-32. Although extracts from 
                the former have been published, this is the first complete edition. 
                <em>The Siege of Malta</em> begins as a novel but ends as a historical 
                account of the defence of Malta by the Order of St John of Jerusalem 
                against much larger Muslim forces. It is an epic tale of endurance, 
                resulting in the most hard-won of victories and setting the scene 
                for the subsequent development of the Maltese nation. In the incomplete 
                novella 'Bizarro', here published for the first time, Scott takes 
                up the story of a notorious Calabrian brigand. He draws upon his 
                experience of visiting Naples and its surroundings and pre-exising 
                knowledge of Neapolitan history to tell a tale of passion, murder 
                and revenge with a level of violence rarely seen in his earlier 
                work. An accompanying CD-Rom provides access to a digital reproduction

                The historical note explores the novel's setting in Palestine 
                during the Third Crusade (1189&#8211;92) and shows how Scott constructs 
                a story of chivalric action, apparently adopting a medieval romance 
                view of the similarities in the values of both sides. But disguise 
                is the leading theme of <em><a href="../works/novels/talisman.html">The 
                Talisman</a></em>: it is not just that characters frequently wear 
                clothing that conceals their identity, but that professions and 
                cultures hide their true nature. In this novel the Christian leaders 
                are divided by a factious criminality, and are contrasted to the 
                magnanimity and decisiveness of Saladin, the leader of the Muslim 
                armies. In a period when the West was fascinated with the exotic 
                East, Scott represents the Muslim other as more humane than the 
                Christian West. <em>The Talisman</em> (the second of Scott's <em>Tales 
                of the Crusaders</em>) is one of Scott's great novels. It is also 
                a bold departure as, for the first time, Scott explores not cultural 
                conflict within a country or society but in the opposition of 
                two world religions.</font></p>

                <em><a href="../works/novels/cavalier.html">Woodstock</a></em>, 
                the editors argue, opens in farce but is one of Scott's darkest 
                novels. It deals with revolution, to Scott the most disturbing 
                of all subjects. Written during the<a href="../biography/finance.html#1826"> 
                financial crisis</a> which led to his insolvency in January 1826, 
                the novel, Scott feared, 'would not stand the test'. Yet it does: 
                it is set in England in 1651 as Parliamentary forces hunt the 
                fugitive Charles Stewart who days previously had been defeated 
                at Worcester. In the superb portrait of Cromwell we see a self-torturing 
                despot who attempts to be in full control in the name of religion; 
                in the rakish Charles we see a man without self-reflection whose 
                own libertarianism after his restoration to the English throne 
                in 1660 permitted a great burgeoning in scientific enquiry and
